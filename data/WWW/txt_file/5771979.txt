a graph-theoretic approach to webpage segmentation we consider the problem of segmenting a webpage into visually and semantically cohesive pieces . our approach is based on formulating an appropriate optimization problem on weighted graphs , where the weights capture if two nodes in the dom tree should be placed together or apart in the segmentation ; we present a learning framework to learn these weights from manually labeled data in a principled manner . our work is a significant departure from previous heuristic and rule-based solutions to the segmentation problem . the results of our empirical analysis bring out interesting aspects of our framework , including variants of the optimization problem and the role of learning .

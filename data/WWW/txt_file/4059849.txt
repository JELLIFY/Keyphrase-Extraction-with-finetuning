combining link and content analysis to estimate semantic similarity search engines use content and link information to crawl , index , retrieve , and rank web pages . the correlations between similarity measures based on these cues and on semantic associations between pages therefore crucially affects the performance of any search tool . here i begin to quantitatively analyze the relationship between content , link , and semantic similarity measures across a massive number of web page pairs . maps of semantic similarity across textual and link similarity highlight the potential and limitations of lexical and link analysis for relevance approximation , and provide us with a way to study whether and how text and link based measures should be combined .

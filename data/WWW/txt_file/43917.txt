edutella : a p2p networking infrastructure based on rdf metadata for the world wide web is important , but metadata for peer-to-peer ( p2p ) networks is absolutely crucial . in this paper we discuss the open source project edutella which builds upon metadata standards defined for the www and aims to provide an rdf-based metadata infrastructure for p2p applications , building on the recently announced jxta framework . we describe the goals and main services this infrastructure will provide and the architecture to connect edutella peers based on exchange of rdf metadata . as the query service is one of the core services of edutella , upon which other services are built , we specify in detail the edutella common data model ( ecdm ) as basis for the edutella query exchange language ( rdf-qel-i ) and format implementing distributed queries over the edutella network . finally , we shortly discuss registration and mediation services , and introduce the prototype and application scenario for our current edutella aware peers .

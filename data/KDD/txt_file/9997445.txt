finding a team of experts in social networks given a task t , a pool of individuals x with different skills , and a social network g that captures the compatibility among these individuals , we study the problem of finding x , a subset of x , to perform the task . we call this the team formation problem . we require that members of x ' not only meet the skill requirements of the task , but can also work effectively together as a team . we measure effectiveness using the communication cost incurred by the subgraph in g that only involves x ' . we study two variants of the problem for two different communication-cost functions , and show that both variants are np-hard . we explore their connections with existing combinatorial problems and give novel algorithms for their solution . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to consider the team formation problem in the presence of a social network of individuals . experiments on the dblp dataset show that our framework works well in practice and gives useful and intuitive results .

trajectory pattern mining the increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies ( gps , gsm networks , etc. ) is leading to the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets and to the opportunity of discovering usable knowledge about movement behavior , which fosters novel applications and services . in this paper , we move towards this direction and develop an extension of the sequential pattern mining paradigm that analyzes the trajectories of moving objects . we introduce trajectory patterns as concise descriptions of frequent behaviors , in terms of both space ( i.e. , the regions of space visited during movements ) and time ( i.e. , the duration of movements ) . in this setting , we provide a general formal statement of the novel mining problem and then study several different instantiations of different complexity . the various approaches are then empirically evaluated over real data and synthetic benchmarks , comparing their strengths and weaknesses .

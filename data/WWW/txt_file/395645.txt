knowledgetree : a distributed architecture for adaptive e-learning this paper presents knowledgetree , an architecture for adaptive e-learning based on distributed reusable intelligent learning activities . the goal of knowledgetree is to bridge the gap between the currently popular approach to web-based education , which is centered on learning management systems vs. the powerful but underused technologies in intelligent tutoring and adaptive hypermedia . this integrative architecture attempts to address both the component-based assembly of adaptive systems and teacher-level reusability .

post-processing inkml for random-access navigation of voluminous handwritten ink documents the goal of this research is the improvement of browsing voluminous inkml data in two areas : ease of rendering continuous ink-flow for replay-browsing , and ease of random access navigation in elearning domains . the notion of real-time random access navigation in ink documents has not yet been fully exploited . users of existing elearning browsers are restricted to viewing static annotated slides that are inferior in quality when compared to actively replaying the same slides with sequenced ink-flow of the annotated freehand writings . we are developing a tool to investigate ways of managing massive inkml data for efficient `` active visible scrolling '' of recorded freehand writings in ink documents . this work will also develop and evaluate new post-processing techniques that take advantage of the relationship between ink volumes and active-rendering times for real-time random access navigation .

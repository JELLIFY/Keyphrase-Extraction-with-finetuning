turning cartwheels : an alternating algorithm for mining redescriptions we present an unusual algorithm involving classification trees -- cartwheels -- where two trees are grown in opposite directions so that they are joined at their leaves . this approach finds application in a new data mining task we formulate , called redescription mining . a redescription is a shift-of-vocabulary , or a different way of communicating information about a given subset of data ; the goal of redescription mining is to find subsets of data that afford multiple descriptions . we highlight the importance of this problem in domains such as bioinformatics , which exhibit an underlying richness and diversity of data descriptors ( e.g. , genes can be studied in a variety of ways ) . cartwheels exploits the duality between class partitions and path partitions in an induced classification tree to model and mine redescriptions . it helps integrate multiple forms of characterizing datasets , situates the knowledge gained from one dataset in the context of others , and harnesses high-level abstractions for uncovering cryptic and subtle features of data . algorithm design decisions , implementation details , and experimental results are presented .

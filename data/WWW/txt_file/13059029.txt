the web of topics : discovering the topology of topic evolution in a corpus in this paper we study how to discover the evolution of topics over time in a time-stamped document collection . our approach is uniquely designed to capture the rich topology of topic evolution inherent in the corpus . instead of characterizing the evolving topics at fixed time points , we conceptually define a topic as a quantized unit of evolutionary change in content and discover topics with the time of their appearance in the corpus . discovered topics are then connected to form a topic evolution graph using a measure derived from the underlying document network . our approach allows inhomogeneous distribution of topics over time and does not impose any topological restriction in topic evolution graphs . we evaluate our algorithm on the acm corpus . the topic evolution graphs obtained from the acm corpus provide an effective and concrete summary of the corpus with remarkably rich topology that are congruent to our background knowledge . in a finer resolution , the graphs reveal concrete information about the corpus that were previously unknown to us , suggesting the utility of our approach as a navigational tool for the corpus .

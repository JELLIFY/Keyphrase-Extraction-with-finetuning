mirror site maintenance based on evolution associations of web directories mirroring web sites is a well-known technique commonly used in the web community . a mirror site should be updated frequently to ensure that it reflects the content of the original site . existing mirroring tools apply page-level strategies to check each page of a site , which is inefficient and expensive . in this paper , we propose a novel site-level mirror maintenance strategy . our approach studies the evolution of web directorystructures and mines association rules between ancestor-descendant web directories . discovered rules indicate the evolution correlations between web directories . thus , when maintaining the mirror of a web site ( directory ) , we can optimally skipsubdirectories which are negatively correlated with it in undergoing significant changes . the preliminary experimental results show that our approach improves the efficiency of the mirror maintenance process significantly while sacrificing slightly in keeping the `` freshness '' of the mirrors .

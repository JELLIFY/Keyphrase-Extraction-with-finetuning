user-centric content freshness metrics for search engines in order to return relevant search results , a search engine must keep its local repository synchronized to the web , but it is usually impossible to attain perfect freshness . hence , it is vital for a production search engine continually to monitor and improve repository freshness . most previous freshness metrics , formulated in the context of developing better synchronization policies , focused on the web crawler while ignoring other parts of a search engine . but , the freshness of documents in a web crawler does not necessarily translate directly into the freshness of search results as seen by users . we propose metrics for measuring freshness from a user 's perspective , which take into account the latency between when documents are crawled and when they are viewed by users , as well as the variation in user click and view frequency among different documents . we also describe a practical implementation of these metrics that were used in a production search engine .

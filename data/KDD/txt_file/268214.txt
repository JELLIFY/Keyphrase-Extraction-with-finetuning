mining data records in web pages a large amount of information on the web is contained in regularly structured objects , which we call data records . such data records are important because they often present the essential information of their host pages , e.g. , lists of products or services . it is useful to mine such data records in order to extract information from them to provide value-added services . existing automatic techniques are not satisfactory because of their poor accuracies . in this paper , we propose a more effective technique to perform the task . the technique is based on two observations about data records on the web and a string matching algorithm . the proposed technique is able to mine both contiguous and non-contiguous data records . our experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing techniques substantially .

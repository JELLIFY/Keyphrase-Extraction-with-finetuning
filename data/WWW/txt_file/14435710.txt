linden : linking named entities with knowledge base via semantic knowledge integrating the extracted facts with an existing knowledge base has raised an urgent need to address the problem of entity linking . specifically , entity linking is the task to link the entity mention in text with the corresponding real world entity in the existing knowledge base . however , this task is challenging due to name ambiguity , textual inconsistency , and lack of world knowledge in the knowledge base . several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem , but they are largely based on the co-occurrence statistics of terms between the text around the entity mention and the document associated with the entity . in this paper , we propose linden , a novel framework to link named entities in text with a knowledge base unifying wikipedia and wordnet , by leveraging the rich semantic knowledge embedded in the wikipedia and the taxonomy of the knowledge base . we extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed linden over two public data sets and empirical results show that linden significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy .

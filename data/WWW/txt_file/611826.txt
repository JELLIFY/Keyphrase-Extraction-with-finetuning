evaluation of edge caching\/offloading for dynamic content delivery as dynamic content becomes increasingly dominant , it becomes an important research topic as how the edge resources such as client-side proxies , which are otherwise underutilized for such content , can be put into use . however , it is unclear what will be the best strategy and the design\/deployment tradeoffs lie therein . in this paper , using one representative e-commerce benchmark , we report our experience of an extensive investigation of different offloading and caching options . our results point out that , while great benefits can be reached in general , advanced offloading strategies can be overly complex and even counter-productive . in contrast , simple augmentation at proxies to enable fragment caching and page composition achieves most of the benefit without compromising important considerations such as security .

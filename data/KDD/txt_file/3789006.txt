topics over time : a non-markov continuous-time model of topical trends this paper presents an lda-style topic model that captures not only the low-dimensional structure of data , but also how the structure changes over time . unlike other recent work that relies on markov assumptions or discretization of time , here each topic is associated with a continuous distribution over timestamps , and for each generated document , the mixture distribution over topics is influenced by both word co-occurrences and the document 's timestamp . thus , the meaning of a particular topic can be relied upon as constant , but the topics ' occurrence and correlations change significantly over time . we present results on nine months of personal email , 17 years of nips research papers and over 200 years of presidential state-of-the-union addresses , showing improved topics , better timestamp prediction , and interpretable trends .

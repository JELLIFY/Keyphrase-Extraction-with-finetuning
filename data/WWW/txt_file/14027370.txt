framework and algorithms for network bucket testing bucket testing , also known as split testing , a\/b testing , or 0\/1 testing , is a widely used method for evaluating users ' satisfaction with new features , products , or services . in order not to expose the whole user base to the new service , the mean user satisfaction rate is estimated by exposing the service only to a few uniformly chosen random users . in a recent work , backstrom and kleinberg , defined the notion of network bucket testing for social services . in this context , users ' interactions are only valid for measurement if some minimal number of their friends are also given the service . the goal is to estimate the mean user satisfaction rate while providing the service to the least number of users . this constraint makes uniform sampling , which is optimal for the traditional case , grossly inefficient . in this paper we introduce a simple general framework for designing and evaluating sampling techniques for network bucket testing . the framework is constructed in a way that sampling algorithms are only required to generate sets of users to which the service should be provided . given an algorithm , the framework produces an unbiased user satisfaction rate estimator and a corresponding variance bound for any network and any user satisfaction function . furthermore , we present several simple sampling algorithms that are evaluated using both synthetic and real social networks . our experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms .

flash crowds and denial of service attacks : characterization and implications for cdns and web sites the paper studies two types of events that often overload web sites to a point when their services are degraded or disrupted entirely - flash events ( fes ) and denial of service attacks ( dos ) . the former are created by legitimate requests and the latter contain malicious requests whose goal is to subvert the normal operation of the site . we study the properties of both types of events with a special attention to characteristics that distinguish the two . identifying these characteristics allows a formulation of a strategy for web sites to quickly discard malicious requests . we also show that some content distribution networks ( cdns ) may not provide the desired level of protection to web sites against flash events . we therefore propose an enhancement to cdns that offers better protection and use trace-driven simulations to study the effect of our enhancement on cdns and web sites .

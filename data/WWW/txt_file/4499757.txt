understanding the function of web elements for mobile content delivery using random walk models in this paper , we describe a method for understanding the function of web elements . it classifies web elements into five functional categories : content ( c ) , related links ( r ) , navigation and support ( n ) , advertisement ( a ) and form ( f ) . we construct five graphs for a web page , and each graph is designed such that most of the probability mass of the stationary distribution is concentrated in nodes belong to its corresponding category . we perform random walks on these graphs until convergence and classify based on its rank value in different graphs . our experiment shows that the new method performed very well comparing to basic machine learning methods .

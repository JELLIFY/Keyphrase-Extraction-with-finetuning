a framework for analysis of dynamic social networks finding patterns of social interaction within a population has wide-ranging applications including : disease modeling , cultural and information transmission , and behavioral ecology . social interactions are often modeled with networks . a key characteristic of social interactions is their continual change . however , most past analyses of social networks are essentially static in that all information about the time that social interactions take place is discarded . in this paper , we propose a new mathematical and computational framework that enables analysis of dynamic social networks and that explicitly makes use of information about when social interactions occur .

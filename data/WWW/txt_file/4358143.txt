comparing apples and oranges : normalized pagerank for evolving graphs pagerank is the best known technique for link-based importance ranking . the computed importance scores , however , are not directly comparable across different snapshots of an evolving graph . we present an efficiently computable normalization for pagerank scores that makes them comparable across graphs . furthermore , we show that the normalized pagerank scores are robust to non-local changes in the graph , unlike the standard pagerank measure .

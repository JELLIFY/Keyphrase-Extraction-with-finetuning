finding hierarchy in directed online social networks social hierarchy and stratification among humans is a well studied concept in sociology . the popularity of online social networks presents an opportunity to study social hierarchy for different types of networks and at different scales . we adopt the premise that people form connections in a social network based on their perceived social hierarchy ; as a result , the edge directions in directed social networks can be leveraged to infer hierarchy . in this paper , we define a measure of hierarchy in a directed online social network , and present an efficient algorithm to compute this measure . we validate our measure using ground truth including wikipedia notability score . we use this measure to study hierarchy in several directed online social networks including twitter , delicious , youtube , flickr , livejournal , and curated lists of several categories of people based on different occupations , and different organizations . our experiments on different online social networks show how hierarchy emerges as we increase the size of the network . this is in contrast to random graphs , where the hierarchy decreases as the network size increases . further , we show that the degree of stratification in a network increases very slowly as we increase the size of the graph .

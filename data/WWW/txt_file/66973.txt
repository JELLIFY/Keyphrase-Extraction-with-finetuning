web browsing performance of wireless thin-client computing web applications are becoming increasingly popular for mobile wireless systems . however , wireless networks can have high packet loss rates , which can degrade web browsing performance on wireless systems . an alternative approach is wireless thin-client computing , in which the web browser runs on a remote thin server with a more reliable wired connection to the internet . a mobile client then maintains a connection to the thin server to receive display updates over the lossy wireless network . to assess the viability of this thin-client approach , we compare the web browsing performance of thin clients against fat clients that run the web browser locally in lossy wireless networks . our results show that thin clients can operate quite effectively over lossy networks . compared to fat clients running web browsers locally , our results show surprisingly that thin clients can be faster and more resilient on web applications over lossy wireless lans despite having to send more data over the network . we characterize and analyze different design choices in various thin-client systems and explain why these approaches can yield superior web browsing performance in lossy wireless networks .

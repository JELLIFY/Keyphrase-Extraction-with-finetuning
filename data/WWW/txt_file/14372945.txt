handling forecast errors while bidding for display advertising most of the online advertising today is sold via an auction , which requires the advertiser to respond with a valid bid within a fraction of a second . as such , most advertisers employ bidding agents to submit bids on their behalf . the architecture of such agents typically has ( 1 ) an offline optimization phase which incorporates the bidder 's knowledge about the market and ( 2 ) an online bidding strategy which simply executes the offline strategy . the online strategy is typically highly dependent on both supply and expected price distributions , both of which are forecast using traditional machine learning methods . in this work we investigate the optimum strategy of the bidding agent when faced with incorrect forecasts . at a high level , the agent can invest resources in improving the forecasts , or can tighten the loop between successive offline optimization cycles in order to detect errors more quickly . we show analytically that the latter strategy , while simple , is extremely effective in dealing with forecast errors , and confirm this finding with experimental evaluations .

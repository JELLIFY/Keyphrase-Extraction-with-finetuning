on incremental maintenance of 2-hop labeling of graphs recent interests on xml , semantic web , and web ontology , among other topics , have sparked a renewed interest on graph-structured databases . a fundamental query on graphs is the reachability test of nodes . recently , 2-hop labeling has been proposed to index large collections of xml and\/or graphs for efficient reachability tests . however , there has been few work on updates of 2-hop labeling . this is compounded by the fact that web data changes over time . in response to these , this paper studies the incremental maintenance of 2-hop labeling . we identify the main reason for the inefficiency of updates of existing 2-hop labels . we propose two updatable 2-hop labelings , hybrids of 2-hop labeling , and their incremental maintenance algorithms . the proposed 2-hop labeling is derived from graph connectivities , as opposed to set cover which is used by all previous work . our experimental evaluation illustrates the space efficiency and update performance of various kinds of 2-hop labeling . the main conclusion is that there is a natural way to spare some index size for update performance in 2-hop labeling .

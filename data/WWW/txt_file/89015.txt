event synchronization for interactive cyberdrama generation on the web : a distributed approach the digital generation of a story in which users have influence over the narrative is emerging as an exciting example of computer-based interactive entertainment . interactive storytelling has existed in non digital versions for thousand of years , but with the advent of the web the demand for enabling distributed cyberdrama generation is becoming increasingly common . to govern the complexity stemming from the distributed generation of complex plots , we have devised an event synchronization service that may be exploited to support the distribution of interactive storytelling activities over the web . the main novelty of our approach is that the semantics of the cyberdrama is exploited to discard obsolete events . this brings to the positive result of speeding up the activity of drama generation , thus enabling an augmented interactivity among dispersed players .

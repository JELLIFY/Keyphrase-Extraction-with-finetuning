consistency-preserving caching of dynamic database content with the growing use of dynamic web content generated from relational databases , traditional caching solutions for through put and latency improvements are ineffective . we describe a middleware layer called ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of queries or results . it achieves this reduction through the use of cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results . these benefits do not require any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the back-end database . further , ganesh does not require modifications to applications , web servers , or database servers , and works with closed-source applications and databases . using two bench marks representative of dynamic web sites , measurements of our prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much as two fold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as ten fold for dataintensive ones .

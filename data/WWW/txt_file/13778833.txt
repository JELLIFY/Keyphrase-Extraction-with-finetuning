design and implementation of contextual information portals this paper presents a system for enabling offline web use to satisfy the information needs of disconnected communities . we describe the design , implementation , evaluation , and pilot deployment of an automated mechanism to construct contextual information portals ( cips ) . cips are large searchable information repositories of web pages tailored to the information needs of a target population . we combine an efficient classifier with a focused crawler to gather the web pages for the portal for any given topic . given a set of topics of interest , our system constructs a cip containing the most relevant pages from the web across these topics . using several secondary school course syllabi , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system for constructing cips for use as an education resource . we evaluate our system across several metrics : classification accuracy , crawl scalability , crawl accuracy and harvest rate . we describe the utility and usability of our system based on a preliminary deployment study at an after-school program in india , and also outline our ongoing larger-scale pilot deployment at five schools in kenya .

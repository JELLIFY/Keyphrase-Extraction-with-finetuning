relational markov models and their application to adaptive web navigation relational markov models ( rmms ) are a generalization of markov models where states can be of different types , with each type described by a different set of variables . the domain of each variable can be hierarchically structured , and shrinkage is carried out over the cross product of these hierarchies . rmms make effective learning possible in domains with very large and heterogeneous state spaces , given only sparse data . we apply them to modeling the behavior of web site users , improving prediction in our proteus architecture for personalizing web sites . we present experiments on an e-commerce and an academic web site showing that rmms are substantially more accurate than alternative methods , and make good predictions even when applied to previously-unvisited parts of the site .

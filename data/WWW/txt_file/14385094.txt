community detection in incomplete information networks with the recent advances in information networks , the problem of community detection has attracted much attention in the last decade . while network community detection has been ubiquitous , the task of collecting complete network data remains challenging in many real-world applications . usually the collected network is incomplete with most of the edges missing . commonly , in such networks , all nodes with attributes are available while only the edges within a few local regions of the network can be observed . in this paper , we study the problem of detecting communities in incomplete information networks with missing edges . we first learn a distance metric to reproduce the link-based distance between nodes from the observed edges in the local information regions . we then use the learned distance metric to estimate the distance between any pair of nodes in the network . a hierarchical clustering approach is proposed to detect communities within the incomplete information networks . empirical studies on real-world information networks demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively detect community structures within incomplete information networks .

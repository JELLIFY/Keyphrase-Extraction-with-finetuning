colibri : fast mining of large static and dynamic graphs low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of a graph are essential in finding patterns ( such as communities ) and detecting anomalies . additionally , it is desirable to track the low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time , efficiently and within limited storage . real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes , but are usually very sparse . however , standard decompositions such as svd do not preserve sparsity . this has led to the development of methods such as cur and cmd , which seek a non-orthogonal basis by sampling the columns and\/or rows of the sparse matrix . however , these approaches will typically produce overcomplete bases , which wastes both space and time . in this paper we propose the family of colibri methods to deal with these challenges . our version for static graphs , colibri-s , iteratively finds a non-redundant basis and we prove that it has no loss of accuracy compared to the best competitors ( cur and cmd ) , while achieving significant savings in space and time : on real data , colibri-s requires much less space and is orders of magnitude faster ( in proportion to the square of the number of non-redundant columns ) . additionally , we propose an efficient update algorithm for dynamic , time-evolving graphs , colibri-d . our evaluation on a large , real network traffic dataset shows that colibri-d is over 100 times faster than the best published competitor ( cmd ) .

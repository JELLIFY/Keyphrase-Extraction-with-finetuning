learning spatially variant dissimilarity ( svad ) measures clustering algorithms typically operate on a feature vector representation of the data and find clusters that are compact with respect to an assumed ( dis ) similarity measure between the data points in feature space . this makes the type of clusters identified highly dependent on the assumed similarity measure . building on recent work in this area , we formally define a class of spatially varying dissimilarity measures and propose algorithms to learn the dissimilarity measure automatically from the data . the idea is to identify clusters that are compact with respect to the unknown spatially varying dissimilarity measure . our experiments show that the proposed algorithms are more stable and achieve better accuracy on various textual data sets when compared with similar algorithms proposed in the literature .

pay as you browse : microcomputations as micropayments in web-based services currently , several online businesses deem that advertising revenues alone are not sufficient to generate profits and are therefore set to charge for online content . in this paper , we explore a complement to the current advertisement model ; more specifically , we propose a micropayment model for non-specialized commodity web-services based on microcomputations . in our model , a user that wishes to access online content offered by a website does not need to register or pay to access the website ; instead , he will accept to run microcomputations on behalf of the website in exchange for access to the content . these microcomputations can , for example , support ongoing computing projects that have clear social benefits ( e.g. , projects relating to hiv , dengue , cancer , etc. ) or can contribute towards commercial computing projects . we argue that this micropayment model is economically and technically viable and that it can be integrated in existing distributed computing frameworks ( e.g. , the boinc platform ) . we implement a preliminary prototype of a system based on our model through which we evaluate its performance and usability . finally , we analyze the security and privacy of our proposal and we show that it ensures payment for the content while preserving the privacy of users .

translating xslt programs to efficient sql queries we present an algorithm for translating xslt programs into sql . our context is that of virtual xml publishing , in which a single xml view is defined from a relational database , and subsequently queried with xslt programs . each xslt program is translated into a single sql query and run entirely in the database engine . our translation works for a large fragment of xslt , which we define , that includes descendant\/ancestor axis , recursive templates , modes , parameters , and aggregates . we put considerable effort in generating correct and efficient sql queries and describe several optimization techniques to achieve this efficiency . we have tested our system on all 22 sql queries of the tpc-h database benchmark which we represented in xslt and then translated back to sql using our translator .

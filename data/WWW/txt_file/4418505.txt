determining the user intent of web search engine queries determining the user intent of web searches is a difficult problem due to the sparse data available concerning the searcher . in this paper , we examine a method to determine the user intent underlying web search engine queries . we qualitatively analyze samples of queries from seven transaction logs from three different web search engines containing more than five million queries . from this analysis , we identified characteristics of user queries based on three broad classifications of user intent . the classifications of informational , navigational , and transactional represent the type of content destination the searcher desired as expressed by their query . we implemented our classification algorithm and automatically classified a separate web search engine transaction log of over a million queries submitted by several hundred thousand users . our findings show that more than 80 % of web queries are informational in nature , with about 10 % each being navigational and transactional . in order to validate the accuracy of our algorithm , we manually coded 400 queries and compared the classification to the results from our algorithm . this comparison showed that our automatic classification has an accuracy of 74 % . of the remaining 25 % of the queries , the user intent is generally vague or multi-faceted , pointing to the need to for probabilistic classification . we illustrate how knowledge of searcher intent might be used to enhance future web search engines .

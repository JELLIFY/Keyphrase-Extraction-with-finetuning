new ensemble methods for evolving data streams advanced analysis of data streams is quickly becoming a key area of data mining research as the number of applications demanding such processing increases . online mining when such data streams evolve over time , that is when concepts drift or change completely , is becoming one of the core issues . when tackling non-stationary concepts , ensembles of classifiers have several advantages over single classifier methods : they are easy to scale and parallelize , they can adapt to change quickly by pruning under-performing parts of the ensemble , and they therefore usually also generate more accurate concept descriptions . this paper proposes a new experimental data stream framework for studying concept drift , and two new variants of bagging : adwin bagging and adaptive-size hoeffding tree ( asht ) bagging . using the new experimental framework , an evaluation study on synthetic and real-world datasets comprising up to ten million examples shows that the new ensemble methods perform very well compared to several known methods .

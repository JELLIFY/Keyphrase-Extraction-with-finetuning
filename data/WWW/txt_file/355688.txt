web object retrieval the primary function of current web search engines is essentially relevance ranking at the document level . however , myriad structured information about real-world objects is embedded in static web pages and online web databases . document-level information retrieval can unfortunately lead to highly inaccurate relevance ranking in answering object-oriented queries . in this paper , we propose a paradigm shift to enable searching at the object level . in traditional information retrieval models , documents are taken as the retrieval units and the content of a document is considered reliable . however , this reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context when multiple copies of information about the same object typically exist . these copies may be inconsistent because of diversity of web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques . if we simply combine the noisy and inaccurate attribute information extracted from different sources , we may not be able to achieve satisfactory retrieval performance . in this paper , we propose several language models for web object retrieval , namely an unstructured object retrieval model , a structured object retrieval model , and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features . we test these models on a paper search engine and compare their performances . we conclude that the hybrid model is the superior by taking into account the extraction errors at varying levels .

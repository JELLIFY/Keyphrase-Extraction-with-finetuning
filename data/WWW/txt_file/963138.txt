ontology-based learning content repurposing this paper investigates basic research issues that need to be addressed for developing an architecture that enables repurposing of learning objects in a flexible way . currently , there are a number of learning object content models ( e.g. the scorm content aggregation model ) that define learning objects and their components in a more or less precise way . however , these models do not allow repurposing of fine-grained components ( sentences , images ) . we developed an ontology-based solution for content repurposing . the ontology is a solid basis for an architecture that will enable on-the-fly access to learning object components and that will facilitate repurposing these components .

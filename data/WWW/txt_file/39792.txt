sweetdeal : representing agent contracts with exceptions using xml rules , ontologies , and process descriptions sweetdeal is a rule-based approach to representation of business contracts that enables software agents to create , evaluate , negotiate , and execute contracts with substantial automation and modularity . it builds upon the situated courteous logic programs knowledge representation in ruleml , the emerging standard for semantic web xml rules . here , we newly extend the sweetdeal approach by also incorporating process knowledge descriptions whose ontologies are represented in daml+oil ( emerging standard for semantic web ontologies ) thereby enabling more complex contracts with behavioral provisions , especially for handling exception conditions ( e.g. , late delivery or non-payment ) that might arise during the execution of the contract . this provides a foundation for representing and automating deals about services -- in particular , about web services , so as to help search , select , and compose them . our system is also the first to combine emerging semantic web standards for knowledge representation of rules ( ruleml ) with ontologies ( daml+oil ) for a practical e-business application domain , and further to do so with process knowledge . this also newly fleshes out the evolving concept of semantic web services . a prototype ( soon public ) is running .

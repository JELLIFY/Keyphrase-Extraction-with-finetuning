globetp : template-based database replication for scalable web applications generic database replication algorithms do not scale linearly in throughput as all update , deletion and insertion ( udi ) queries must be applied to every database replica . the throughput is therefore limited to the point where the number of udi queries alone is sufficient to overload one server . in such scenarios , partial replication of a database can help , as udi queries are executed only by a subset of all servers . in this paper we propose globetp , a system that employs partial replication to improve database throughput . globetp exploits the fact that a web application 's query workload is composed of a small set of read and write templates . using knowledge of these templates and their respective execution costs , globetp provides database table placements that produce significant improvements in database throughput . we demonstrate the efficiency of this technique using two different industry standard benchmarks . in our experiments , globetp increases the throughput by 57 % to 150 % compared to full replication , while using identical hardware configuration . furthermore , adding a single query cache improves the throughput by another 30 % to 60 % .

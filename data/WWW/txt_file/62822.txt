a large-scale study of the evolution of web pages how fast does the web change ? does most of the content remain unchanged once it has been authored , or are the documents continuously updated ? do pages change a little or a lot ? is the extent of change correlated to any other property of the page ? all of these questions are of interest to those who mine the web , including all the popular search engines , but few studies have been performed to date to answer them . one notable exception is a study by cho and garcia-molina , who crawled a set of 720,000 pages on a daily basis over four months , and counted pages as having changed if their md5 checksum changed . they found that 40 % of all web pages in their set changed within a week , and 23 % of those pages that fell into the . com domain changed daily . this paper expands on cho and garcia-molina 's study , both in terms of coverage and in terms of sensitivity to change . we crawled a set of 150,836,209 html pages once every week , over a span of 11 weeks . for each page , we recorded a checksum of the page , and a feature vector of the words on the page , plus various other data such as the page length , the http status code , etc. . moreover , we pseudo-randomly selected 0.1 % of all of our urls , and saved the full text of each download of the corresponding pages . after completion of the crawl , we analyzed the degree of change of each page , and investigated which factors are correlated with change intensity . we found that the average degree of change varies widely across top-level domains , and that larger pages change more often and more severely than smaller ones . this paper describes the crawl and the data transformations we performed on the logs , and presents some statistical observations on the degree of change of different classes of pages .

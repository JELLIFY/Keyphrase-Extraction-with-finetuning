octopus : aggressive search of multi-modality data using multifaceted knowledge base an important trend in web information processing is the support of multimedia retrieval . however , the most prevailing paradigm for multimedia retrieval , content-based retrieval ( cbr ) , is a rather conservative one whose performance depends on a set of specifically defined low-level features and a carefully chosen sample object . in this paper , an aggressive search mechanism called octopus is proposed which addresses the retrieval of multi-modality data using multifaceted knowledge . in particular , octopus promotes a novel scenario in which the user supplies seed objects of arbitrary modality as the hint of his information need , and receives a set of multi-modality objects satisfying his need . the foundation of octopus is a multifaceted knowledge base constructed on a layered graph model ( lgm ) , which describes the relevance between media objects from various perspectives . link analysis based retrieval algorithm is proposed based on the lgm . a unique relevance feedback technique is developed to update the knowledge base by learning from user behaviors , and to enhance the retrieval performance in a progressive manner . a prototype implementing the proposed approach has been developed to demonstrate its feasibility and capability through illustrative examples .

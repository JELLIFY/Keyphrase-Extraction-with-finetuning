the chatty web : emergent semantics through gossiping this paper describes a novel approach for obtaining semantic interoperability among data sources in a bottom-up , semi-automatic manner without relying on pre-existing , global semantic models . we assume that large amounts of data exist that have been organized and annotated according to local schemas . seeing semantics as a form of agreement , our approach enables the participating data sources to incrementally develop global agreement in an evolutionary and completely decentralized process that solely relies on pair-wise , local interactions : participants provide translations between schemas they are interested in and can learn about other translations by routing queries ( gossiping ) . to support the participants in assessing the semantic quality of the achieved agreements we develop a formal framework that takes into account both syntactic and semantic criteria . the assessment process is incremental and the quality ratings are adjusted along with the operation of the system . ultimately , this process results in global agreement , i.e. , the semantics that all participants understand . we discuss strategies to efficiently find translations and provide results from a case study to justify our claims . our approach applies to any system which provides a communication infrastructure ( existing websites or databases , decentralized systems , p2p systems ) and offers the opportunity to study semantic interoperability as a global phenomenon in a network of information sharing parties .

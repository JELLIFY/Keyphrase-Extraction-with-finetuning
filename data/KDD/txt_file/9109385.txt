anonymizing transaction databases for publication this paper considers the problem of publishing `` transaction data '' for research purposes . each transaction is an arbitrary set of items chosen from a large universe . detailed transaction data provides an electronic image of one 's life . this has two implications . one , transaction data are excellent candidates for data mining research . two , use of transaction data would raise serious concerns over individual privacy . therefore , before transaction data is released for data mining , it must be made anonymous so that data subjects can not be re-identified . the challenge is that transaction data has no structure and can be extremely high dimensional . traditional anonymization methods lose too much information on such data . to date , there has been no satisfactory privacy notion and solution proposed for anonymizing transaction data . this paper proposes one way to address this issue .

closegraph : mining closed frequent graph patterns recent research on pattern discovery has progressed form mining frequent itemsets and sequences to mining structured patterns including trees , lattices , and graphs . as a general data structure , graph can model complicated relations among data with wide applications in bioinformatics , web exploration , and etc. . however , mining large graph patterns in challenging due to the presence of an exponential number of frequent subgraphs . instead of mining all the subgraphs , we propose to mine closed frequent graph patterns . a graph g is closed in a database if there exists no proper supergraph of g that has the same support as g. a closed graph pattern mining algorithm , closegraph , is developed by exploring several interesting pruning methods . our performance study shows that closegraph not only dramatically reduces unnecessary subgraphs to be generated but also substantially increases the efficiency of mining , especially in the presence of large graph patterns .

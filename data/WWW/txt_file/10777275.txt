implementing the media fragments uri specification in this paper , we describe two examples of implementations of the media fragments uri specification which is currently being developed by the w3c media fragments working group . the group 's mission is to create standard addressing schemes for media fragments on the web using uniform resource identifiers ( uris ) . we describe two scenarios to illustrate the implementations . more specifically , we show how user agents ( ua ) will either be able to resolve media fragment uris without help from the server , or will make use of a media fragments-aware server . finally , we present some ongoing discussions and issues regarding the implementation of the media fragments specification .

a flexible learning system for wrapping tables and lists in html documents a program that makes an existing website look like a database is called a wrapper . wrapper learning is the problem of learning website wrappers from examples . we present a wrapper-learning system called wl2 that can exploit several different representations of a document . examples of such different representations include dom-level and token-level representations , as well as two-dimensional geometric views of the rendered page ( for tabular data ) and representations of the visual appearance of text asm it will be rendered . additionally , the learning system is modular , and can be easily adapted to new domains and tasks . the learning system described is part of an `` industrial-strength '' wrapper management system that is in active use at whizbang labs . controlled experiments show that the learner has broader coverage and a faster learning rate than earlier wrapper-learning systems .

learning to rank networked entities several algorithms have been proposed to learn to rank entities modeled as feature vectors , based on relevance feedback . however , these algorithms do not model network connections or relations between entities . meanwhile , pagerank and variants find the stationary distribution of a reasonable but arbitrary markov walk over a network , but do not learn from relevance feedback . we present a framework for ranking networked entities based on markov walks with parameterized conductance values associated with the network edges . we propose two flavors of conductance learning problems in our framework . in the first setting , relevance feedback comparing node-pairs hints that the user has one or more hidden preferred communities with large edge conductance , and the algorithm must discover these communities . we present a constrained maximum entropy network flow formulation whose dual can be solved efficiently using a cutting-plane approach and a quasi-newton optimizer . in the second setting , edges have types , and relevance feedback hints that each edge type has a potentially different conductance , but this is fixed across the whole network . our algorithm learns the conductances using an approximate newton method .

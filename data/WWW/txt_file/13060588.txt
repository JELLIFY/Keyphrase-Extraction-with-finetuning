factal : integrating deep web based on trust and relevance we demonstrate `` factal '' -- a system for integrating deep web sources . factal is based on the recently introduced source selection method `` sourcerank '' ; which is a measure of trust and relevance based on the agreement between the sources . sourcerank selects popular and trustworthy sources from autonomous and open collections like the deep web . this trust and popularity awareness distinguishes factal from the existing systems like google product search . factal selects and searches active online databases on multiple domains . the demonstration scenarios include improved trustworthiness , relevance of results , and comparison shopping . we believe that by incorporating effective source selection based on the sourcerank , factal demonstrates a significant step towards a deep-web-scale integration system .

totalrank : ranking without damping pagerank is defined as the stationary state of a markov chain obtained by perturbing the transition matrix of a web graph with a damping factor α that spreads part of the rank . the choice of α is eminently empirical , but most applications use α = 0.85 ; nonetheless , the selection of α is critical , and some believe that link farms may use this choice adversarially . recent results ( 1 ) prove that the pagerank of a page is a rational function of α , and that this function can be approximated quite efficiently : this fact can be used to define a new form of ranking , totalrank , that averages pageranks over all possible α 's . we show how this rank can be computed efficiently , and provide some preliminary experimental results on its quality and comparisons with pagerank .

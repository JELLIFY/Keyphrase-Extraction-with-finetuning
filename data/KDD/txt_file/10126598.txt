efficient anomaly monitoring over moving object trajectory streams lately there exist increasing demands for online abnormality monitoring over trajectory streams , which are obtained from moving object tracking devices . this problem is challenging due to the requirement of high speed data processing within limited space cost . in this paper , we present a novel framework for monitoring anomalies over continuous trajectory streams . first , we illustrate the importance of distance-based anomaly monitoring over moving object trajectories . then , we utilize the local continuity characteristics of trajectories to build local clusters upon trajectory streams and monitor anomalies via efficient pruning strategies . finally , we propose a piecewise metric index structure to reschedule the joining order of local clusters to further reduce the time cost . our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods .

leveraging user comments for aesthetic aware image search reranking the increasing number of images available online has created a growing need for efficient ways to search for relevant content . text-based query search is the most common approach to retrieve images from the web . in this approach , the similarity between the input query and the metadata of images is used to find relevant information . however , as the amount of available images grows , the number of relevant images also increases , all of them sharing very similar metadata but differing in other visual characteristics . this paper studies the influence of visual aesthetic quality in search results as a complementary attribute to relevance . by considering aesthetics , a new ranking parameter is introduced aimed at improving the quality at the top ranks when large amounts of relevant results exist . two strategies for aesthetic rating inference are proposed : one based on visual content , another based on the analysis of user comments to detect opinions about the quality of images . the results of a user study with $ 58 $ participants show that the comment-based aesthetic predictor outperforms the visual content-based strategy , and reveals that aesthetic-aware rankings are preferred by users searching for photographs on the web .

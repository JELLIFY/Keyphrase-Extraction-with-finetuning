a hybrid unsupervised approach for document clustering we propose a hybrid , unsupervised document clustering approach that combines a hierarchical clustering algorithm with expectation maximization . we developed several heuristics to automatically select a subset of the clusters generated by the first algorithm as the initial points of the second one . furthermore , our initialization algorithm generates not only an initial model for the iterative refinement algorithm but also an estimate of the model dimension , thus eliminating another important element of human supervision . we have evaluated the proposed system on five real-world document collections . the results show that our approach generates clustering solutions of higher quality than both its individual components .

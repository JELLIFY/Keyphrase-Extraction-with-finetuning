p2cast : peer-to-peer patching scheme for vod service providing video on demand ( vod ) service over the internet in a scalable way is a challenging problem . in this paper , we propose p2cast - an architecture that uses a peer-to-peer approach to cooperatively stream video using patching techniques , while only relying on unicast connections among peers . we address the following two key technical issues in p2cast : ( 1 ) constructing an application overlay appropriate for streaming ; and ( 2 ) providing continuous stream playback ( without glitches ) in the face of disruption from an early departing client . our simulation experiments show that p2cast can serve many more clients than traditional client-server unicast service , and that it generally out-performs multicast-based patching if clients can cache more than of a stream 's initial portion . we handle disruptions by delaying the start of playback and applying the shifted forwarding technique . a threshold on the length of time during which arriving clients are served in a single session in p2cast serves as a knob to adjust the balance between the scalability and the clients ' viewing quality in p2cast .

a more precise model for web retrieval most research works on web retrieval latency are object-level based , which we think is insufficient and sometimes inaccurate . in this paper , we propose a fine grained operation-level web retrieval dependency model ( wrdm ) to provide more precise capture of web retrieval process . our model reveals some new factors in web retrieval which can not be seen at object level but are very important to studies in the web retrieval area .

position paper : a comparison of two modelling paradigms in the semantic web classical logics and datalog-related logics have both been proposed as underlying formalisms for the semantic web . although these two different formalism groups have some commonalities , and look similar in the context of expressively-impoverished languages like rdf , their differences become apparent at more expressive language levels . after considering some of these differences , we argue that , although some of the characteristics of datalog have their utility , the open environment of the semantic web is better served by standard logics .

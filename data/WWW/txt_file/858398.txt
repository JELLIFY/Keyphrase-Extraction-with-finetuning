hardening web browsers against man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping attacks existing web browsers handle security errors in a manner that often confuses users . in particular , when a user visits a secure site whose certificate the browser can not verify , the browser typically allows the user to view and install the certificate and connect to the site despite the verification failure . however , few users understand the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and the principles behind certificate-based authentication . we propose context-sensitive certificate verification ( cscv ) , whereby the browser interrogates the user about the context in which a certificate verification error occurs . considering the context , the browser then guides the user in handling and possibly overcoming the security error . we also propose specific password warnings ( spw ) when users are about to send passwords in a form vulnerable to eavesdropping . we performed user studies to evaluate cscv and spw . our results suggest that cscv and spw can greatly improve web browsing security and are easy to use even without training . moreover , cscv had greater impact than did staged security training .

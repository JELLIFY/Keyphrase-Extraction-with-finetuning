probabilistic workflow mining in several organizations , it has become increasingly popular to document and log the steps that makeup a typical business process . in some situations , a normative workflow model of such processes is developed , and it becomes important to know if such a model is actually being followed by analyzing the available activity logs . in other scenarios , no model is available and , with the purpose of evaluating cases or creating new production policies , one is interested in learning a workflow representation of such activities . in either case , machine learning tools that can mine workflow models are of great interest and still relatively unexplored . we present here a probabilistic workflow model and a corresponding learning algorithm that runs in polynomial time . we illustrate the algorithm on example data derived from a real world workflow .

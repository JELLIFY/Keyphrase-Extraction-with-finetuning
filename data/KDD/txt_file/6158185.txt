mining progressive confident rules many real world objects have states that change over time . by tracking the state sequences of these objects , we can study their behavior and take preventive measures before they reach some undesirable states . in this paper , we propose a new kind of pattern called progressive confident rules to describe sequences of states with an increasing confidence that lead to a particular end state . we give a formal definition of progressive confident rules and their concise set . we devise pruning strategies to reduce the enormous search space . experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient and scalable . we also demonstrate the application of progressive confident rules in classification .

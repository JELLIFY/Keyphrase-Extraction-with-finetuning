visually guided bottom-up table detection and segmentation in web documents in the allright project , we are developing an algorithm for unsupervised table detection and segmentation that uses the visual rendition of a web page rather than the html code . our algorithm works bottom-up by grouping word bounding boxes into larger groups and uses a set of heuristics . it has already been implemented and a preliminary evaluation on about 6000 web documents has been carried out .

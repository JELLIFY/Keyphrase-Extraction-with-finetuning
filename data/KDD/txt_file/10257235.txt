on the tradeoff between privacy and utility in data publishing in data publishing , anonymization techniques such as generalization and bucketization have been designed to provide privacy protection . in the meanwhile , they reduce the utility of the data . it is important to consider the tradeoff between privacy and utility . in a paper that appeared in kdd 2008 , brickell and shmatikov proposed an evaluation methodology by comparing privacy gain with utility gain resulted from anonymizing the data , and concluded that `` even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility '' . this conclusion seems to undermine existing work on data anonymization . in this paper , we analyze the fundamental characteristics of privacy and utility , and show that it is inappropriate to directly compare privacy with utility . we then observe that the privacy-utility tradeoff in data publishing is similar to the risk-return tradeoff in financial investment , and propose an integrated framework for considering privacy-utility tradeoff , borrowing concepts from the modern portfolio theory for financial investment . finally , we evaluate our methodology on the adult dataset from the uci machine learning repository . our results clarify several common misconceptions about data utility and provide data publishers useful guidelines on choosing the right tradeoff between privacy and utility .

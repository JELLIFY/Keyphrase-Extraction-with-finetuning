privacy preserving frequency capping in internet banner advertising we describe an optimize-and-dispatch approach for delivering pay-per-impression advertisements in online advertising . the platform provider for an advertising network commits to showing advertisers ' banner ads while capping the number of advertising message shown to a unique user as the user transitions through the network . the traditional approach for enforcing frequency caps has been to use cross-site cookies to track users . however,cross-site cookies and other tracking mechanisms can infringe on the user privacy . in this paper , we propose a novel linear programming approach that decides when to show an ad to the user based solely on the page currently viewed by the users . we show that the frequency caps are fulfilled in expectation . we show the efficacy of that approach using simulation results .

need for non-visual feedback with long response times in mobile hci when browsing web pages with a mobile device , the system response times are variable and much longer than on a pc . users must repeatedly glance at the display to see when the page finally arrives , although mobility demands a minimal attention user interface . we conducted a user study with 27 participants to discover the point at which visual feedback stops reaching the user in mobile context . in the study , we examined the deployment of attention during page loading to the phone vs. the environment in several different everyday mobility contexts , and compared these to the laboratory context . the first part of the page appeared on the screen typically in 11 seconds , but we found that the user 's visual attention shifted away from the mobile browser usually between 4 and 8 seconds in the mobile context . in contrast , the continuous span of attention to the browser was more than 14 seconds in the laboratory condition . based on our study results , we recommend mobile applications provide multimodal feedback for delays of more than four seconds .

enhancing diversity , coverage and balance for summarization through structure learning document summarization plays an increasingly important role with the exponential growth of documents on the web . many supervised and unsupervised approaches have been proposed to generate summaries from documents . however , these approaches seldom simultaneously consider summary diversity , coverage , and balance issues which to a large extent determine the quality of summaries . in this paper , we consider extract-based summarization emphasizing the following three requirements : 1 ) diversity in summarization , which seeks to reduce redundancy among sentences in the summary ; 2 ) sufficient coverage , which focuses on avoiding the loss of the document 's main information when generating the summary ; and 3 ) balance , which demands that different aspects of the document need to have about the same relative importance in the summary . we formulate the extract-based summarization problem as learning a mapping from a set of sentences of a given document to a subset of the sentences that satisfies the above three requirements . the mapping is learned by incorporating several constraints in a structure learning framework , and we explore the graph structure of the output variables and employ structural svm for solving the resulted optimization problem . experiments on the duc2001 data sets demonstrate significant performance improvements in terms of f1 and rouge metrics .

unsupervised query categorization using automatically-built concept graphs automatic categorization of user queries is an important component of general purpose ( web ) search engines , particularly for triggering rich , query-specific content and sponsored links . we propose an unsupervised learning scheme that reduces dramatically the cost of setting up and maintaining such a categorizer , while retaining good categorization power . the model is stored as a graph of concepts where graph edges represent the cross-reference between the concepts . concepts and relations are extracted from query logs by an offline web mining process , which uses a search engine as a powerful summarizer for building a concept graph . empirical evaluation indicates that the system compares favorably on publicly available data sets ( such as kdd cup 2005 ) as well as on portions of the current query stream of yahoo ! search , where it is already changing the experience of millions of web search users .

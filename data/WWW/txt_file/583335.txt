fractal summarization for mobile devices to access large documents on the web wireless access with mobile ( or handheld ) devices is a promising addition to the www and traditional electronic business . mobile devices provide convenience and portable access to the huge information space on the internet without requiring users to be stationary with network connection . however , the limited screen size , narrow network bandwidth , small memory capacity and low computing power are the shortcomings of handheld devices . loading and visualizing large documents on handheld devices become impossible . the limited resolution restricts the amount of information to be displayed . the download time is intolerably long . in this paper , we introduce the fractal summarization model for document summarization on handheld devices . fractal summarization is developed based on the fractal theory . it generates a brief skeleton of summary at the first stage , and the details of the summary on different levels of the document are generated on demands of users . such interactive summarization reduces the computation load in comparing with the generation of the entire summary in one batch by the traditional automatic summarization , which is ideal for wireless access . three-tier architecture with the middle-tier conducting the major computation is also discussed . visualization of summary on handheld devices is also investigated .

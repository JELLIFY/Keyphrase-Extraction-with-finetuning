the sowes approach to p2p web search using semantic overlays peer-to-peer ( p2p ) web search has gained a lot of interest lately , due to the salient characteristics of p2p systems , namely scalability , fault-tolerance and load-balancing . however , the lack of global knowledge in a vast and dynamically evolving environment like the web presents a grand challenge for organizing content and providing efficient searching . semantic overlay networks ( sons ) have been proposed as an approach to reduce cost and increase quality of results , and in this paper we present an unsupervised approach for distributed and decentralized son construction , aiming to support efficient search mechanisms in unstructured p2p systems .

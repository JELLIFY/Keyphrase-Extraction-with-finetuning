large scale integration of senses for the semantic web nowadays , the increasing amount of semantic data available on the web leads to a new stage in the potential of semantic web applications . however , it also introduces new issues due to the heterogeneity of the available semantic resources . one of the most remarkable is redundancy , that is , the excess of different semantic descriptions , coming from different sources , to describe the same intended meaning . in this paper , we propose a technique to perform a large scale integration of senses ( expressed as ontology terms ) , in order to cluster the most similar ones , when indexing large amounts of online semantic information . it can dramatically reduce the redundancy problem on the current semantic web . in order to make this objective feasible , we have studied the adaptability and scalability of our previous work on sense integration , to be translated to the much larger scenario of the semantic web . our evaluation shows a good behavior of these techniques when used in large scale experiments , then making feasible the proposed approach .

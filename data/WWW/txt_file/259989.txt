staging transformations for multimodal web interaction management multimodal interfaces are becoming increasingly ubiquitous with the advent of mobile devices , accessibility considerations , and novel software technologies that combine diverse interaction media . in addition to improving access and delivery capabilities , such interfaces enable flexible and personalized dialogs with websites , much like a conversation between humans . in this paper , we present a software framework for multimodal web interaction management that supports mixed-initiative dialogs between users and websites . a mixed-initiative dialog is one where the user and the website take turns changing the flow of interaction . the framework supports the functional specification and realization of such dialogs using staging transformations -- a theory for representing and reasoning about dialogs based on partial input . it supports multiple interaction interfaces , and offers sessioning , caching , and co-ordination functions through the use of an interaction manager . two case studies are presented to illustrate the promise of this approach .

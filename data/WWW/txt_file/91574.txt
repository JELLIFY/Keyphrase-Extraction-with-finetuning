using web structure for classifying and describing web pages the structure of the web is increasingly being used to improve organization , search , and analysis of information on the web . for example , google uses the text in citing documents ( documents that link to the target document ) for search . we analyze the relative utility of document text , and the text in citing documents near the citation , for classification and description . results show that the text in citing documents , when available , often has greater discriminative and descriptive power than the text in the target document itself . the combination of evidence from a document and citing documents can improve on either information source alone . moreover , by ranking words and phrases in the citing documents according to expected entropy loss , we are able to accurately name clusters of web pages , even with very few positive examples . our results confirm , quantify , and extend previous research using web structure in these areas , introducing new methods for classification and description of pages .

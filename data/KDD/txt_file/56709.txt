idr\/qr : an incremental dimension reduction algorithm via qr decomposition dimension reduction is critical for many database and data mining applications , such as efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data . in the literature , a well-known dimension reduction scheme is linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) . the common aspect of previously proposed lda based algorithms is the use of singular value decomposition ( svd ) . due to the difficulty of designing an incremental solution for the eigenvalue problem on the product of scatter matrices in lda , there is little work on designing incremental lda algorithms . in this paper , we propose an lda based incremental dimension reduction algorithm , called idr\/qr , which applies qr decomposition rather than svd . unlike other lda based algorithms , this algorithm does not require the whole data matrix in main memory . this is desirable for large data sets . more importantly , with the insertion of new data items , the idr\/qr algorithm can constrain the computational cost by applying efficient qr-updating techniques . finally , we evaluate the effectiveness of the idr\/qr algorithm in terms of classification accuracy on the reduced dimensional space . our experiments on several real-world data sets reveal that the accuracy achieved by the idr\/qr algorithm is very close to the best possible accuracy achieved by other lda based algorithms . however , the idr\/qr algorithm has much less computational cost , especially when new data items are dynamically inserted .

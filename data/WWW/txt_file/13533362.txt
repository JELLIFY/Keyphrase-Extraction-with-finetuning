spatio-temporal models for estimating click-through rate we propose novel spatio-temporal models to estimate click-through rates in the context of content recommendation . we track article ctr at a fixed location over time through a dynamic gamma-poisson model and combine information from correlated locations through dynamic linear regressions , significantly improving on per-location model . our models adjust for user fatigue through an exponential tilt to the first-view ctr ( probability of click on first article exposure ) that is based only on user-specific repeat-exposure features . we illustrate our approach on data obtained from a module ( today module ) published regularly on yahoo ! front page and demonstrate significant improvement over commonly used baseline methods . large scale simulation experiments to study the performance of our models under different scenarios provide encouraging results . throughout , all modeling assumptions are validated via rigorous exploratory data analysis .

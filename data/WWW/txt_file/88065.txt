qos computation and policing in dynamic web service selection the emerging service-oriented computing ( soc ) paradigm promises to enable businesses and organizations to collaborate in an unprecedented way by means of standard web services . to support rapid and dynamic composition of services in this paradigm , web services that meet requesters ' functional requirements must be able to be located and bounded dynamically from a large and constantly changing number of service providers based on their quality of service ( qos ) . in order to enable quality-driven web service selection , we need an open , fair , dynamic and secure framework to evaluate the qos of a vast number of web services . the fair computation and enforcing of qos of web services should have minimal overhead but yet able to achieve sufficient trust by both service requesters and providers . in this paper , we presented our open , fair and dynamic qos computation model for web services selection through implementation of and experimentation with a qos registry in a hypothetical phone service provisioning market place application .

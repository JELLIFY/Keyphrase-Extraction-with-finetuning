a microeconomic data mining problem : customer-oriented catalog segmentation the microeconomic framework for data mining ( 7 ) assumes that an enterprise chooses a decision maximizing the overall utility over all customers where the contribution of a customer is a function of the data available on that customer . in catalog segmentation , the enterprise wants to design k product catalogs of size r that maximize the overall number of catalog products purchased . however , there are many applications where a customer , once attracted to an enterprise , would purchase more products beyond the ones contained in the catalog . therefore , in this paper , we investigate an alternative problem formulation , that we call customer-oriented catalog segmentation , where the overall utility is measured by the number of customers that have at least a specified minimum interest t in the catalogs . we formally introduce the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem and discuss its complexity . then we investigate two different paradigms to design efficient , approximate algorithms for the customer-oriented catalog segmentation problem , greedy ( deterministic ) and randomized algorithms . since greedy algorithms may be trapped in a local optimum and randomized algorithms crucially depend on a reasonable initial solution , we explore a combination of these two paradigms . our experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data demonstrates that the new algorithms yield catalogs of significantly higher utility compared to classical catalog segmentation algorithms .

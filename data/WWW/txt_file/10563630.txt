earthquake shakes twitter users : real-time event detection by social sensors twitter , a popular microblogging service , has received much attention recently . an important characteristic of twitter is its real-time nature . for example , when an earthquake occurs , people make many twitter posts ( tweets ) related to the earthquake , which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly , simply by observing the tweets . as described in this paper , we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event . to detect a target event , we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet , the number of words , and their context . subsequently , we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location . we consider each twitter user as a sensor and apply kalman filtering and particle filtering , which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous\/pervasive computing . the particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons . as an application , we construct an earthquake reporting system in japan . because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of twitter users throughout the country , we can detect an earthquake with high probability ( 96 % of earthquakes of japan meteorological agency ( jma ) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected ) merely by monitoring tweets . our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users . notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the jma .

analysis of interacting bpel web services this paper presents a set of tools and techniques for analyzing interactions of composite web services which are specified in bpel and communicate through asynchronous xml messages . we model the interactions of composite web services as conversations , the global sequence of messages exchanged by the web services . as opposed to earlier work , our tool-set handles rich data manipulation via xpath expressions . this allows us to verify designs at a more detailed level and check properties about message content . we present a framework where bpel specifications of web services are translated to an intermediate representation , followed by the translation of the intermediate representation to a verification language . as an intermediate representation we use guarded automata augmented with unbounded queues for incoming messages , where the guards are expressed as xpath expressions . as the target verification language we use promela , input language of the model checker spin . since spin model checker is a finite-state verification tool we can only achieve partial verification by fixing the sizes of the input queues in the translation . we propose the concept of synchronizability to address this problem . we show that if a composite web service is synchronizable , then its conversation set remains same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication . we give a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee synchronizability and that can be checked statically . based on our synchronizability results , we show that a large class of composite web services with unbounded input queues can be completely verified using a finite state model checker such as spin .

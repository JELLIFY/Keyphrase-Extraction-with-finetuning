context-sensitive query auto-completion query auto completion is known to provide poor predictions of the user 's query when her input prefix is very short ( e.g. , one or two characters ) . in this paper we show that context , such as the user 's recent queries , can be used to improve the prediction quality considerably even for such short prefixes . we propose a context-sensitive query auto completion algorithm , nearestcompletion , which outputs the completions of the user 's input that are most similar to the context queries . to measure similarity , we represent queries and contexts as high-dimensional term-weighted vectors and resort to cosine similarity . the mapping from queries to vectors is done through a new query expansion technique that we introduce , which expands a query by traversing the query recommendation tree rooted at the query . in order to evaluate our approach , we performed extensive experimentation over the public aol query log . we demonstrate that when the recent user 's queries are relevant to the current query she is typing , then after typing a single character , nearestcompletion 's mrr is 48 % higher relative to the mrr of the standard mostpopularcompletion algorithm on average . when the context is irrelevant , however , nearestcompletion 's mrr is essentially zero . to mitigate this problem , we propose hybridcompletion , which is a hybrid of nearestcompletion with mostpopularcompletion . hybridcompletion is shown to dominate both nearestcompletion and mostpopularcompletion , achieving a total improvement of 31.5 % in mrr relative to mostpopularcompletion on average .

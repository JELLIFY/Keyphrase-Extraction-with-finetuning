web4ce : accessing web-based applications on consumer devices in a world where all devices will be interconnected , the boundaries between the different devices will start to disappear . devices will be able to access each other 's applications ; sessions can be suspended on one device and resumed on another device ; devices can serve as each other 's input and output device , and all devices will be able to connect to the internet . this will give true mobility to the user as he\/she will not be restricted to the time and location where he\/she accesses an application . of course , we need a variety of different mechanisms and technologies to enable this , such as : remote rendering of uis on other devices in the network . infrastructure for discovering client and servers in a network . mechanisms to exchange capability information between devices , and to adapt the ui based on these capabilities . mechanisms to deal with session migration . support for a wide range of consumer devices , ranging from mobile phones to high-end tvs . this requires technologies that cross different domains , i.e. the pc domain , mobile domain , and tv domain . several major companies within these different domains have decided to work together on these issues . one of the results is a framework for remote user interfaces for both upnp '' networks and the internet . this framework is called web4ce ( a.k.a. cea-2014 ) ( 1 ) , and has been accepted as the baseline remote user interface technology within the digital living network alliance ( dlna ) ( 2 ) , which is a large industry-wide effort for creating true interoperability between network-enabled devices . this paper provides a short overview of the web4ce framework , and some of the use cases that it enables .

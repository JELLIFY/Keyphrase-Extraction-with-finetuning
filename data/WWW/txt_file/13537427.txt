search result re-ranking based on gap between search queries and social tags both search engine click-through log and social annotation have been utilized as user feedback for search result re-ranking . however , to our best knowledge , no previous study has explored the correlation between these two factors for the task of search result ranking . in this paper , we show that the gap between search queries and social tags of the same web page can well reflect its user preference score . motivated by this observation , we propose a novel algorithm , called query-tag-gap ( qtg ) , to re-rank search results for better user satisfaction . intuitively , on one hand , the search users ' intentions are generally described by their queries before they read the search results . on the other hand , the web annotators semantically tag web pages after they read the content of the pages . the difference between users ' recognition of the same page before and after they read it is a good reflection of user satisfaction . in this extended abstract , we formally define the query set and tag set of the same page as users ' pre - and post - knowledge respectively . we empirically show the strong correlation between user satisfaction and user 's knowledge gap before and after reading the page . based on this gap , experiments have shown outstanding performance of our proposed qtg algorithm in search result re-ranking .

bbm : bayesian browsing model from petabyte-scale data given a quarter of petabyte click log data , how can we estimate the relevance of each url for a given query ? in this paper , we propose the bayesian browsing model ( bbm ) , a new modeling technique with following advantages : ( a ) it does exact inference ; ( b ) it is single-pass and parallelizable ; ( c ) it is effective . we present two sets of experiments to test model effectiveness and efficiency . on the first set of over 50 million search instances of 1.1 million distinct queries , bbm out-performs the state-of-the-art competitor by 29.2 % in log-likelihood while being 57 times faster . on the second click-log set , spanning a quarter of petabyte data , we showcase the scalability of bbm : we implemented it on a commercial mapreduce cluster , and it took only 3 hours to compute the relevance for 1.15 billion distinct query-url pairs .

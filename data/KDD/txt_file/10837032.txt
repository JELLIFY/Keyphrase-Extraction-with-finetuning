pervasive parallelism in data mining : dataflow solution to co-clustering large and sparse netflix data all netflix prize algorithms proposed so far are prohibitively costly for large-scale production systems . in this paper , we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering ( cf ) solution to the netflix prize problem ( 1 ) based on weighted coclustering ( 5 ) . the dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware , while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing , threading , memory management , and deadlocks . the dataflow cf implementation first compresses the large , sparse training dataset into co-clusters . then it generates recommendations by combining the average ratings of the co-clusters with the biases of the users and movies . when configured to identify 20x20 co-clusters in the netflix training dataset , the implementation predicted over 100 million ratings in 16.31 minutes and achieved an rmse of 0.88846 without any fine-tuning or domain knowledge . this is an effective real-time prediction runtime of 9.7 us per rating which is far superior to previously reported results . moreover , the implemented co-clustering framework supports a wide variety of other large-scale data mining applications and forms the basis for predictive modeling on large , dyadic datasets ( 4 , 7 ) .

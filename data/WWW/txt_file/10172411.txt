a search-based method for forecasting ad impression in contextual advertising contextual advertising ( also called content match ) refers to the placement of small textual ads within the content of a generic web page . it has become a significant source of revenue for publishers ranging from individual bloggers to major newspapers . at the same time it is an important way for advertisers to reach their intended audience . this reach depends on the total number of exposures of the ad ( impressions ) and its click-through-rate ( ctr ) that can be viewed as the probability of an end-user clicking on the ad when shown . these two orthogonal , critical factors are both difficult to estimate and even individually can still be very informative and useful in planning and budgeting advertising campaigns . in this paper , we address the problem of forecasting the number of impressions for new or changed ads in the system . producing such forecasts , even within large margins of error , is quite challenging : 1 ) ad selection in contextual advertising is a complicated process based on tens or even hundreds of page and ad features ; 2 ) the publishers ' content and traffic vary over time ; and 3 ) the scale of the problem is daunting : over a course of a week it involves billions of impressions , hundreds of millions of distinct pages , hundreds of millions of ads , and varying bids of other competing advertisers . we tackle these complexities by simulating the presence of a given ad with its associated bid over weeks of historical data . we obtain an impression estimate by counting how many times the ad would have been displayed if it were in the system over that period of time . we estimate this count by an efficient two-level search algorithm over the distinct pages in the data set . experimental results show that our approach can accurately forecast the expected number of impressions of contextual ads in real time . we also show how this method can be used in tools for bid selection and ad evaluation .

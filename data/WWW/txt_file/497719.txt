updating pagerank with iterative aggregation we present an algorithm for updating the pagerank vector ( 1 ) . due to the scale of the web , google only updates its famous pagerank vector on a monthly basis . however , the web changes much more frequently . drastically speeding the pagerank computation can lead to fresher , more accurate rankings of the webpages retrieved by search engines . it can also make the goal of real-time personalized rankings within reach . on two small subsets of the web , our algorithm updates pagerank using just 25 % and 14 % , respectively , of the time required by the original pagerank algorithm . our algorithm uses iterative aggregation techniques ( 7 , 8 ) to focus on the slow-converging states of the markov chain . the most exciting feature of this algorithm is that it can be joined with other pagerank acceleration methods , such as the dangling node lumpability algorithm ( 6 ) , quadratic extrapolation ( 4 ) , and adaptive pagerank ( 3 ) , to realize even greater speedups ( potentially a factor of 60 or more speedup when all algorithms are combined ) . every few weeks . our solution harnesses the power of iterative aggregation principles for markov chains to allow for much more frequent updates to the valuable ranking vectors .

relational data pre-processing techniques for improved securities fraud detection commercial datasets are often large , relational , and dynamic . they contain many records of people , places , things , events and their interactions over time . such datasets are rarely structured appropriately for knowledge discovery , and they often contain variables whose meanings change across different subsets of the data . we describe how these challenges were addressed in a collaborative analysis project undertaken by the university of massachusetts amherst and the national association of securities dealers ( nasd ) . we describe several methods for data pre-processing that we applied to transform a large , dynamic , and relational dataset describing nearly the entirety of the u.s. securities industry , and we show how these methods made the dataset suitable for learning statistical relational models . to better utilize social structure , we first applied known consolidation and link formation techniques to associate individuals with branch office locations . in addition , we developed an innovative technique to infer professional associations by exploiting dynamic employment histories . finally , we applied normalization techniques to create a suitable class label that adjusts for spatial , temporal , and other heterogeneity within the data . we show how these pre-processing techniques combine to provide the necessary foundation for learning high-performing statistical models of fraudulent activity .

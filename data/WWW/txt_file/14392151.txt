towards network-aware service composition in the cloud service-oriented computing ( soc ) enables the composition of loosely coupled services provided with varying quality of service ( qos ) levels . selecting a ( near - ) optimal set of services for a composition in terms of qos is crucial when many functionally equivalent services are available . with the advent of cloud computing , both the number of such services and their distribution across the network are rising rapidly , increasing the impact of the network on the qos of such compositions . despite this , current approaches do not differentiate between the qos of services themselves and the qos of the network . therefore , the computed latency differs substantially from the actual latency , resulting in suboptimal qos for service compositions in the cloud . thus , we propose a network-aware approach that handles the qos of services and the qos of the network independently . first , we build a network model in order to estimate the network latency between arbitrary services and potential users . our selection algorithm then leverages this model to find compositions that will result in a low latency given an employed execution policy . in our evaluation , we show that our approach efficiently computes compositions with much lower latency than current approaches .

search shortcuts : driving users towards their goals giving suggestions to users of web-based services is a common practice aimed at enhancing their navigation experience . major web search engines usually provide `` suggestions '' under the form of queries that are , to some extent , related to the current query typed by the user , and the knowledge learned from the past usage of the system . in this work we introduce `` search shortcuts '' as `` successful '' queries allowed , in the past , users to satisfy their information needs . differently from conventional suggestion techniques , our search shortcuts allows to evaluate effectiveness by exploiting a simple train-and-test approach . we have applied several collaborative filtering algorithms to this problem , evaluating them on a real query log data . we generate the shortcuts from all user sessions belonging to the testing set , and measure the quality of the shortcuts suggested by considering the similarity between them and the navigational user behavior .

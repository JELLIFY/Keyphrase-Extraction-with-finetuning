information diffusion through blogspace we study the dynamics of information propagation in environments of low-overhead personal publishing , using a large collection of weblogs over time as our example domain . we characterize and model this collection at two levels . first , we present a macroscopic characterization of topic propagation through our corpus , formalizing the notion of long-running `` chatter '' topics consisting recursively of `` spike '' topics generated by outside world events , or more rarely , by resonances within the community . second , we present a microscopic characterization of propagation from individual to individual , drawing on the theory of infectious diseases to model the flow . we propose , validate , and employ an algorithm to induce the underlying propagation network from a sequence of posts , and report on the results .

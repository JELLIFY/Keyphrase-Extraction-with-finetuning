practical learning from one-sided feedback in many data mining applications , online labeling feedback is only available for examples which were predicted to belong to the positive class . such applications includespam filtering in the case where users never checkemails marked `` spam '' , document retrieval where users cannotgive relevance feedback on unretrieved documents , and online advertising where user behavior can not beobserved for unshown advertisements . one-sided feedback can cripple the performance of classical mistake-driven online learners such as perceptron . previous work under the apple tasting framework showed how to transform standard online learners into successful learners from one sided feedback . however , we find in practice that this transformation may request more labels than necessary to achieve strong performance . in this paper , we employ two active learning methods which reduce the number of labels requested in practice . one method is the use of label efficient active learning . the other method , somewhat surprisingly , is the use of margin-based learners without modification , which we show combines implicit active learning and a greedy strategy to managing the exploration exploitation tradeoff . experimental results show that these methods can be significantly more effective in practice than those using the apple tasting transformation , even on minority class problems .

interpreting distributed ontologies semantic web is challenged by the uri meaning issues arising from putting ontologies in open and distributed environments . as a try to clarify some of the meaning issues , this paper proposes a new approach to interpreting distributed ontologies , it 's built on the top of local models semantics , and extends it to deal with the uri sharing by harmonizing the local models via agreement on vocabulary provenance . the commitment relationship is presented to allow the uri sharing between ontologies with richer semantics .

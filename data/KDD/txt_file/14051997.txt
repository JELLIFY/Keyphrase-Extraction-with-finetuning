sparsification of influence networks we present spine , an efficient algorithm for finding the `` backbone '' of an influence network . given a social graph and a log of past propagations , we build an instance of the independent-cascade model that describes the propagations . we aim at reducing the complexity of that model , while preserving most of its accuracy in describing the data . we show that the problem is inapproximable and we present an optimal , dynamic-programming algorithm , whose search space , albeit exponential , is typically much smaller than that of the brute force , exhaustive-search approach . seeking a practical , scalable approach to sparsification , we devise spine , a greedy , efficient algorithm with practically little compromise in quality . we claim that sparsification is a fundamental data-reduction operation with many applications , ranging from visualization to exploratory and descriptive data analysis . as a proof of concept , we use spine on real-world datasets , revealing the backbone of their influence-propagation networks . moreover , we apply spine as a pre-processing step for the influence-maximization problem , showing that computations on sparsified models give up little accuracy , but yield significant improvements in terms of scalability .

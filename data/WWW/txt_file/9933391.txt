using graphics processors for high performance ir query processing web search engines are facing formidable performance challenges due to data sizes and query loads . the major engines have to process tens of thousands of queries per second over tens of billions of documents . to deal with this heavy workload , such engines employ massively parallel systems consisting of thousands of machines . the significant cost of operating these systems has motivated a lot of recent research into more efficient query processing mechanisms . we investigate a new way to build such high performance ir systems using graphical processing units ( gpus ) . gpus were originally designed to accelerate computer graphics applications through massive on-chip parallelism . recently a number of researchers have studied how to use gpus for other problem domains such as databases and scientific computing . our contribution here is to design a basic system architecture for gpu-based high-performance ir , to develop suitable algorithms for subtasks such as inverted list compression , list intersection , and top - $ k $ scoring , and to show how to achieve highly efficient query processing on gpu-based systems . our experimental results for a prototype gpu-based system on $ 25.2 $ million web pages indicate that significant gains in query processing performance can be obtained .

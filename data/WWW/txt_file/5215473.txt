towards a flash search engine based on expressive semantics flash , as a multimedia format , becomes more and more popular on the web . however , previous works on flash are totally based on low-level features , which make it unpractical to build a content-based flash search engine . to address this problem , our paper proposes expressive semantics for bridging the gap between low-level features and user queries . to smoothly incorporate expressive semantics into a search engine , an eigenvector-based model is devised to map a user query to expressive semantics with the aid of link analysis method . our experiment results confirm that expressive semantics is a promising approach to understanding and hence searching flash movies more efficiently .

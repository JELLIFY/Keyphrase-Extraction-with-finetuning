automatically generating labels based on unified click model ground truth labels are one of the most important parts in many test collections for information retrieval . each label , depicting the relevance between a query-document pair , is usually judged by a human , and this process is time-consuming and labor-intensive . automatically generating labels from click-through data has attracted increasing attention . in this paper , we propose a unified click model to predict the multi-level labels , which aims at comprehensively considering the advantages of the position models and cascade models . experiments show that the proposed click model outperforms the existing click models in predicting the multi-level labels , and could replace the labels judged by humans for test collections .

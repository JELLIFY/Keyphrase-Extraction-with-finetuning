thresher : automating the unwrapping of semantic content from the world wide web we describe thresher , a system that lets non-technical users teach their browsers how to extract semantic web content from html documents on the world wide web . users specify examples of semantic content by highlighting them in a web browser and describing their meaning . we then use the tree edit distance between the dom subtrees of these examples to create a general pattern , or wrapper , for the content , and allow the user to bind rdf classes and predicates to the nodes of these wrappers . by overlaying matches to these patterns on standard documents inside the haystack semantic web browser , we enable a rich semantic interaction with existing web pages , `` unwrapping '' semantic data buried in the pages ' html . by allowing end-users to create , modify , and utilize their own patterns , we hope to speed adoption and use of the semantic web and its applications .

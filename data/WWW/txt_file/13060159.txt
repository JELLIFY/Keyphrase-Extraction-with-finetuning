comparative study of clustering techniques for short text documents we compare various document clustering techniques including k-means , svd-based method and a graph-based approach and their performance on short text data collected from twitter . we define a measure for evaluating the cluster error with these techniques . observations show that graph-based approach using affinity propagation performs best in clustering short text data with minimal cluster error .

on compressing social networks motivated by structural properties of the web graph that support efficient data structures for in memory adjacency queries , we study the extent to which a large network can be compressed . boldi and vigna ( www 2004 ) , showed that web graphs can be compressed down to three bits of storage per edge ; we study the compressibility of social networks where again adjacency queries are a fundamental primitive . to this end , we propose simple combinatorial formulations that encapsulate efficient compressibility of graphs . we show that some of the problems are np-hard yet admit effective heuristics , some of which can exploit properties of social networks such as link reciprocity . our extensive experiments show that social networks and the web graph exhibit vastly different compressibility characteristics .

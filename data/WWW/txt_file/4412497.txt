a probabilistic approach to spatiotemporal theme pattern mining on weblogs mining subtopics from weblogs and analyzing their spatiotemporal patterns have applications in multiple domains . in this paper , we define the novel problem of mining spatiotemporal theme patterns from weblogs and propose a novel probabilistic approach to model the subtopic themes and spatiotemporal theme patterns simultaneously . the proposed model discovers spatiotemporal theme patterns by ( 1 ) extracting common themes from weblogs ; ( 2 ) generating theme life cycles for each given location ; and ( 3 ) generating theme snapshots for each given time period . evolution of patterns can be discovered by comparative analysis of theme life cycles and theme snapshots . experiments on three different data sets show that the proposed approach can discover interesting spatiotemporal theme patterns effectively . the proposed probabilistic model is general and can be used for spatiotemporal text mining on any domain with time and location information .

behavioral classification on the click graph a bipartite query-url graph , where an edge indicates that a document was clicked for a query , is a useful construct for finding groups of related queries and urls . here we use this behavior graph for classification . we choose a click graph sampled from two weeks of image search activity , and the task of `` adult '' filtering : identifying content in the graph that is inappropriate for minors . we show how to perform classification using random walks on this graph , and two methods for estimating classifier parameters .

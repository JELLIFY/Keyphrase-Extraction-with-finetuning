anycast cdns revisited because it is an integral part of the internet routing apparatus , and because it allows multiple instances of the same service to be `` naturally '' discovered , ip anycast has many attractive features for any service that involve the replication of multiple instances across the internet . while briefly considered as an enabler when content distribution networks ( cdns ) first emerged , the use of ip anycast was deemed infeasible in that environment . the main reasons for this decision were the lack of load awareness of ip anycast and unwanted side effects of internet routing changes on the ip anycast mechanism . prompted by recent developments in route control technology , as well as a better understanding of the behavior of ip anycast in operational settings , we revisit this decision and propose a load-aware ip anycast cdn architecture that addresses these concerns while benefiting from inherent ip anycast features . our architecture makes use of route control mechanisms to take server and network load into account to realize load-aware anycast . we show that the resulting redirection requirements can be formulated as a generalized assignment problem and present practical algorithms that address these requirements while at the same time limiting session disruptions that plague regular ip anycast . we evaluate our algorithms through trace based simulation using traces obtained from an operation cdn network .

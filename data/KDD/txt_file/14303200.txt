towards parameter-free data mining most data mining algorithms require the setting of many input parameters . two main dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are the following . first , incorrect settings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns . second , a perhaps more insidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist , or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns . this is especially likely when the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process . data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible , ideally none . a parameter-free algorithm would limit our ability to impose our prejudices , expectations , and presumptions on the problem at hand , and would let the data itself speak to us . in this work , we show that recent results in bioinformatics and computational theory hold great promise for a parameter-free data-mining paradigm . the results are motivated by observations in kolmogorov complexity theory . however , as a practical matter , they can be implemented using any off-the-shelf compression algorithm with the addition of just a dozen or so lines of code . we will show that this approach is competitive or superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in anomaly\/interestingness detection , classification , and clustering with empirical tests on time series\/dna\/text \/ video datasets .

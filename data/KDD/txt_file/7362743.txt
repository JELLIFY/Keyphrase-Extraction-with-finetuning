automatic record linkage using seeded nearest neighbor and support vector machine classification the task of linking databases is an important step in an increasing number of data mining projects , because linked data can contain information that is not available otherwise , or that would require time-consuming and expensive collection of specific data . the aim of linking is to match and aggregate all records that refer to the same entity . one of the major challenges when linking large databases is the efficient and accurate classification of record pairs into matches and non-matches . while traditionally classification was based on manually-set thresholds or on statistical procedures , many of the more recently developed classification methods are based on supervised learning techniques . they therefore require training data , which is often not available in real world situations or has to be prepared manually , an expensive , cumbersome and time-consuming process . the author has previously presented a novel two-step approach to automatic record pair classification ( 6 , 7 ) . in the first step of this approach , training examples of high quality are automatically selected from the compared record pairs , and used in the second step to train a support vector machine ( svm ) classifier . initial experiments showed the feasibility of the approach , achieving results that outperformed k-means clustering . in this paper , two variations of this approach are presented . the first is based on a nearest-neighbour classifier , while the second improves a svm classifier by iteratively adding more examples into the training sets . experimental results show that this two-step approach can achieve better classification results than other unsupervised approaches .

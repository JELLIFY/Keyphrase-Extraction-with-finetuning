consideration set generation in commerce search in commerce search , the set of products returned by a search engine often forms the basis for all user interactions leading up to a potential transaction on the web . such a set of products is known as the consideration set . in this study , we consider the problem of generating consideration set of products in commerce search so as to maximize user satisfaction . one of the key features of commerce search that we exploit in our study is the association of a set of important attributes with the products and a set of specified attributes with the user queries . those important attributes not used in the query are treated as unspecified . the attribute space admits a natural definition of user satisfaction via user preferences on the attributes and their values , viz . require that the surfaced products be close to the specified attribute values in the query , and diverse with respect to the unspecified attributes . we model this as a general max-sum dispersion problem wherein we are given a set of n nodes in a metric space and the objective is to select a subset of nodes with total cost at most a given budget , and maximize the sum of the pairwise distances between the selected nodes . in our setting , each node denotes a product , the cost of a node being inversely proportional to its relevance with respect to specified attributes . the distance between two nodes quantifies the diversity with respect to the unspecified attributes . the problem is np-hard and a 2-approximation was previously known only when all the nodes have unit cost . in our setting , we do not make any assumptions on the cost . we label this problem as the general max-sum dispersion problem . we give the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem , achieving an approximation ratio of 2 . further , we perform extensive empirical analysis on real-world data to show the effectiveness of our algorithm .

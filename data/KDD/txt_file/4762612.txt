mining relational data through correlation-based multiple view validation commercial relational databases currently store vast amounts of real-world data . the data within these relational repositories are represented by multiple relations , which are inter-connected by means of foreign key joins . the mining of such interrelated data poses a major challenge to the data mining community . unfortunately , traditional data mining algorithms usually only explore one relation , the so-called target relation , thus excluding crucial knowledge embedded in the related so-called background relations . in this paper , we propose a novel approach for classifying relational such domains . this strategy employs multiple views to capture crucial information not only from the target relation , but also from related relations . this information is integrated into the relational mining process . the framework presented here , firstly , explore the relational domain to partition its features space into multiple subsets . subsequently , these subsets are used to construct multiple uncorrelated views , based on a novel correlation-based view validation method , against the target concept . finally , the knowledge possessed by multiple views are incorporated into a meta-learning mechanism to augment one another . based on this framework , a wide range of conventional data mining methods can be applied to mine relational databases . our experiments on benchmark real-world data sets show that the proposed method achieves promising results both in terms of overall accuracy obtained and run time , when compared with two other relational data mining approaches .

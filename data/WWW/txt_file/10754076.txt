context-aware citation recommendation when you write papers , how many times do you want to make some citations at a place but you are not sure which papers to cite ? do you wish to have a recommendation system which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that you want to make some citations ? in this paper , we present our initiative of building a context-aware citation recommendation system . high quality citation recommendation is challenging : not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper under composition , but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made . moreover , it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations . to tackle the problem , we develop a context-aware approach . the core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document . our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively . moreover , it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality . we implement a prototype system in citeseerx . an extensive empirical evaluation in the citeseerx digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach .

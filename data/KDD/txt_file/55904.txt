xrules : an effective structural classifier for xml data xml documents have recently become ubiquitous because of their varied applicability in a number of applications . classification is an important problem in the data mining domain , but current classification methods for xml documents use ir-based methods in which each document is treated as a bag of words . such techniques ignore a significant amount of information hidden inside the documents . in this paper we discuss the problem of rule based classification of xml data by using frequent discriminatory substructures within xml documents . such a technique is more capable of finding the classification characteristics of documents . in addition , the technique can also be extended to cost sensitive classification . we show the effectiveness of the method with respect to other classifiers . we note that the methodology discussed in this paper is applicable to any kind of semi-structured data .

a game theoretic formulation of the service provisioning problem in cloud systems cloud computing is an emerging paradigm which allows the on-demand delivering of software , hardware , and data as services . as cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic , the development of efficient service provisioning policies become increasingly challenging . game theoretic approaches have shown to gain a thorough analytical understanding of the service provisioning problem . in this paper we take the perspective of software as a service ( saas ) providers which host their applications at an infrastructure as a service ( iaas ) provider . each saas needs to comply with quality of service requirements , specified in service level agreement ( sla ) contracts with the end-users , which determine the revenues and penalties on the basis of the achieved performance level . saas providers want to maximize their revenues from slas , while minimizing the cost of use of resources supplied by the iaas provider . moreover , saas providers compete and bid for the use of infrastructural resources . on the other hand , the iaas wants to maximize the revenues obtained providing virtualized resources . in this paper we model the service provisioning problem as a generalized nash game , and we propose an efficient algorithm for the run time management and allocation of iaas resources to competing saass .

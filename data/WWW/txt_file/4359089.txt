finding visual concepts by web image mining we propose measuring `` visualness '' of concepts with images on the web , that is , what extent concepts have visual characteristics . this is a new application of `` web image mining '' . to know which concept has visually discriminative power is important for image recognition , since not all concepts are related to visual contents . mining image data on the web with our method enables it . our method performs probabilistic region selection for images and computes an entropy measure which represents `` visualness '' of concepts . in the experiments , we collected about forty thousand images from the web for 150 concepts . we examined which concepts are suitable for annotation of image contents .

ad-hoc object retrieval in the web of data semantic search refers to a loose set of concepts , challenges and techniques having to do with harnessing the information of the growing web of data ( wod ) for web search . here we propose a formal model of one specific semantic search task : ad-hoc object retrieval . we show that this task provides a solid framework to study some of the semantic search problems currently tackled by commercial web search engines . we connect this task to the traditional ad-hoc document retrieval and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics . finally , we carry out a realistic evaluation of this task in the context of a web search application .

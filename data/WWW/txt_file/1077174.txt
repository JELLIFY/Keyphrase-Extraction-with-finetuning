dew : dns-enhanced web for faster content delivery with a key component of latency on the web being connection set up between clients and web servers , several ways to avoid connections have been explored . while the work in recent years on content distribution networks ( cdns ) have moved some content ` closer ' to users at the cost of increasing dns traffic , they have not fully exploited the available unused potential of existing protocols . we explore ways by which a variety of web responses can be piggybacked on dns messages . while we evaluated our idea in the web context , the approach is generic and not restricted to web responses . we propose an architecture for http piggybacking in dns messages and carry out a detailed performance analysis based on a trace-driven simulation study . our architecture requires minimal extensions to existing protocols , utilizing only the allowed optional fields for these extensions . it is fully compatible and can coexist with the current web .

how much can behavioral targeting help online advertising ? behavioral targeting ( bt ) is a technique used by online advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns , and is playing an increasingly important role in the online advertising market . however , it is underexplored in academia when looking at how much bt can truly help online advertising in commercial search engines . to answer this question , in this paper we provide an empirical study on the click-through log of advertisements collected from a commercial search engine . from the comprehensively experiment results on the sponsored search log of the commercial search engine over a period of seven days , we can draw three important conclusions : ( 1 ) users who clicked the same ad will truly have similar behaviors on the web ; ( 2 ) click-through rate ( ctr ) of an ad can be averagely improved as high as 670 % by properly segmenting users for behavioral targeted advertising in a sponsored search ; ( 3 ) using the short term user behaviors to represent users is more effective than using the long term user behaviors for bt . the statistical t-test verifies that all conclusions drawn in the paper are statistically significant . to the best of our knowledge , this work is the first empirical study for bt on the click-through log of real world ads .

the infocious web search engine : improving web searching through linguistic analysis in this paper we present the infocious web search engine ( 23 ) . our goal in creating infocious is to improve the way people find information on the web by resolving ambiguities present in natural language text . this is achieved by performing linguistic analysis on the content of the web pages we index , which is a departure from existing web search engines that return results mainly based on keyword matching . this additional step of linguistic processing gives infocious two main advantages . first , infocious gains a deeper understanding of the content of web pages so it can better match users ' queries with indexed documents and therefore can improve relevancy of the returned results . second , based on its linguistic processing , infocious can organize and present the results to the user in more intuitive ways . in this paper we present the linguistic processing technologies that we incorporated in infocious and how they are applied in helping users find information on the web more efficiently . we discuss the various components in the architecture of infocious and how each of them benefits from the added linguistic processing . finally , we experimentally evaluate the performance of a component which leverages linguistic information in order to categorize web pages .

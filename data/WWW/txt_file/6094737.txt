mining the search trails of surfing crowds : identifying relevant websites from user activity the paper proposes identifying relevant information sources from the history of combined searching and browsing behavior of many web users . while it has been previously shown that user interactions with search engines can be employed to improve document ranking , browsing behavior that occurs beyond search result pages has been largely overlooked in prior work . the paper demonstrates that users ' post-search browsing activity strongly reflects implicit endorsement of visited pages , which allows estimating topical relevance of web resources by mining large-scale datasets of search trails . we present heuristic and probabilistic algorithms that rely on such datasets for suggesting authoritative websites for search queries . experimental evaluation shows that exploiting complete post-search browsing trails outperforms alternatives in isolation ( e.g. , clickthrough logs ) , and yields accuracy improvements when employed as a feature in learning to rank for web search .

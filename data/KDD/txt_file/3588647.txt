efficient data reduction with ease a variety of mining and analysis problems -- ranging from association-rule discovery to contingency table analysis to materialization of certain approximate datacubes -- involve the extraction of knowledge from a set of categorical count data . such data can be viewed as a collection of `` transactions , '' where a transaction is a fixed-length vector of counts . classical algorithms for solving count-data problems require one or more computationally intensive passes over the entire database and can be prohibitively slow . one effective method for dealing with this ever-worsening scalability problem is to run the algorithms on a small sample of the data . we present a new data-reduction algorithm , called ease , for producing such a sample . like the fast algorithm introduced by chen et al. , ease is especially designed for count data applications . both ease and fast take a relatively large initial random sample and then deterministically produce a subsample whose `` distance '' -- appropriately defined -- from the complete database is minimal . unlike fast , which obtains the final subsample by quasi-greedy descent , ease uses epsilon-approximation methods to obtain the final subsample by a process of repeated halving . experiments both in the context of association rule mining and classical Ï‡2 contingency-table analysis show that ease outperforms both fast and simple random sampling , sometimes dramatically .

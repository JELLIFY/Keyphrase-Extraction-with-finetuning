tjfast : effective processing of xml twig pattern matching finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern in an xml database is a core operation for efficient evaluation of xml queries . a number of algorithms have been proposed to process a twig query based on region encoding . in this paper , based on a novel labeling scheme : extended dewey , we propose a novel and efficient holistic twig join algorithm , namely tjfast . compared to previous work , our algorithm only needs to access the labels of leaf query nodes . we report our experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches in terms of the number of elements scanned and query performance .

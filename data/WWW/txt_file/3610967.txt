building adaptable and reusable xml applications with model transformations we present an approach in which the semantics of an xml language is defined by means of a transformation from an xml document model ( an xml schema ) to an application specific model . the application specific model implements the intended behavior of documents written in the language . a transformation is specified in a model transformation language used in the model driven architecture ( mda ) approach for software development . our approach provides a better separation of three concerns found in xml applications : syntax , syntax processing logic and intended meaning of the syntax . it frees the developer of low-level syntactical details and improves the adaptability and reusability of xml applications . declarative transformation rules and the explicit application model provide a finer control over the application parts affected by adaptations . transformation rules and the application model for an xml language may be composed with the corresponding rules and application models defined for other xml languages . in that way we achieve reuse and composition of xml applications .

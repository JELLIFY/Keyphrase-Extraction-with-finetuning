xar-miner : efficient association rules mining for xml data in this paper , we propose a framework , called xar-miner , for mining ars from xml documents efficiently . in xar-miner , raw data in the xml document are first preprocessed to transform to either an indexed content tree ( ix-tree ) or multi-relational databases ( multi-db ) , depending on the size of xml document and memory constraint of the system , for efficient data selection and ar mining . task-relevant concepts are generalized to produce generalized meta-patterns , based on which the large ars that meet the support and confidence levels are generated .

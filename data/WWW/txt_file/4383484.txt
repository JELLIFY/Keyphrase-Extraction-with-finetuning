effort estimation : how valuable is it for a web company to use a cross-company data set , compared to using its own single-company data set ? previous studies comparing the prediction accuracy of effort models built using web cross - and single-company data sets have been inconclusive , and as such replicated studies are necessary to determine under what circumstances a company can place reliance on a cross-company effort model . this paper therefore replicates a previous study by investigating how successful a cross-company effort model is : i ) to estimate effort for web projects that belong to a single company and were not used to build the cross-company model ; ii ) compared to a single-company effort model . our single-company data set had data on 15 web projects from a single company and our cross-company data set had data on 68 web projects from 25 different companies . the effort estimates used in our analysis were obtained by means of two effort estimation techniques , namely forward stepwise regression and case-based reasoning . our results were similar to those from the replicated study , showing that predictions based on the single-company model were significantly more accurate than those based on the cross-company model .

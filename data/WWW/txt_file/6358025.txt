supporting anonymous location queries in mobile environments with privacygrid this paper presents privacygrid - a framework for supporting anonymous location-based queries in mobile information delivery systems . the privacygrid framework offers three unique capabilities . first , it provides a location privacy protection preference profile model , called location p3p , which allows mobile users to explicitly define their preferred location privacy requirements in terms of both location hiding measures ( e.g. , location k-anonymity and location l-diversity ) and location service quality measures ( e.g. , maximum spatial resolution and maximum temporal resolution ) . second , it provides fast and effective location cloaking algorithms for location k-anonymity and location l-diversity in a mobile environment . we develop dynamic bottom-up and top-down grid cloaking algorithms with the goal of achieving high anonymization success rate and efficiency in terms of both time complexity and maintenance cost . a hybrid approach that carefully combines the strengths of both bottom-up and top-down cloaking approaches to further reduce the average anonymization time is also developed . last but not the least , privacygrid incorporates temporal cloaking into the location cloaking process to further increase the success rate of location anonymization . we also discuss privacygrid mechanisms for supporting anonymous location queries . experimental evaluation shows that the privacygrid approach can provide close to optimal location k-anonymity as defined by per user location p3p without introducing significant performance penalties .

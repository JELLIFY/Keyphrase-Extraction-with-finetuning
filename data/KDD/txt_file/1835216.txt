efficient decision tree construction on streaming data decision tree construction is a well studied problem in data mining . recently , there has been much interest in mining streaming data . domingos and hulten have presented a one-pass algorithm for decision tree construction . their work uses hoeffding inequality to achieve a probabilistic bound on the accuracy of the tree constructed . in this paper , we revisit this problem . we make the following two contributions : 1 ) we present a numerical interval pruning ( nip ) approach for efficiently processing numerical attributes . our results show an average of 39 % reduction in execution times . 2 ) we exploit the properties of the gain function entropy ( and gini ) to reduce the sample size required for obtaining a given bound on the accuracy . our experimental results show a 37 % reduction in the number of data instances required .

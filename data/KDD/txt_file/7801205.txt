regression error characteristic surfaces this paper presents a generalization of regression error characteristic ( rec ) curves . rec curves describe the cumulative distribution function of the prediction error of models and can be seen as a generalization of roc curves to regression problems . rec curves provide useful information for analyzing the performance of models , particularly when compared to error statistics like for instance the mean squared error . in this paper we present regression error characteristic ( rec ) surfaces that introduce a further degree of detail by plotting the cumulative distribution function of the errors across the distribution of the target variable , i.e. the joint cumulative distribution function of the errors and the target variable . this provides a more detailed analysis of the performance of models when compared to rec curves . this extra detail is particularly relevant in applications with non-uniform error costs , where it is important to study the performance of models for specific ranges of the target variable . in this paper we present the notion of rec surfaces , describe how to use them to compare the performance of models , and illustrate their use with an important practical class of applications : the prediction of rare extreme values .

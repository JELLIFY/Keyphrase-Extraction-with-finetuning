off the beaten tracks : exploring three aspects of web navigation this paper presents results of a long-term client-side web usage study , updating previous studies that range in age from five to ten years . we focus on three aspects of web navigation : changes in the distribution of navigation actions , speed of navigation and within-page navigation . `` navigation actions√∂ corresponding to users ' individual page requests are discussed by type . we reconfirm links to be the most important navigation element , while backtracking has lost more than half of its previously reported share and form submission has become far more common . changes of the web and the browser interfaces are candidates for causing these changes . analyzing the time users stayed on pages , we confirm web navigation to be a rapidly interactive activity . a breakdown of page characteristics shows that users often do not take the time to read the available text or consider all links . the performance of the web is analyzed and reassessed against the resulting requirements . finally , habits of within-page navigation are presented . although most selected hyperlinks are located in the top left corner of the = screen , in nearly a quarter of all cases people choose links that require scrolling . we analyzed the available browser real estate to gain insights for the design of non-scrolling web pages .

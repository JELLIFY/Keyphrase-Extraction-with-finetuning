text joins in an rdbms for web data integration the integration of data produced and collected across autonomous , heterogeneous web services is an increasingly important and challenging problem . due to the lack of global identifiers , the same entity ( e.g. , a product ) might have different textual representations across databases . textual data is also often noisy because of transcription errors , incomplete information , and lack of standard formats . a fundamental task during data integration is matching of strings that refer to the same entity . in this paper , we adopt the widely used and established cosine similarity metric from the information retrieval field in order to identify potential string matches across web sources . we then use this similarity metric to characterize this key aspect of data integration as a join between relations on textual attributes , where the similarity of matches exceeds a specified threshold . computing an exact answer to the text join can be expensive . for query processing efficiency , we propose a sampling-based join approximation strategy for execution in a standard , unmodified relational database management system ( rdbms ) , since more and more web sites are powered by rdbmss with a web-based front end . we implement the join inside an rdbms , using sql queries , for scalability and robustness reasons . finally , we present a detailed performance evaluation of an implementation of our algorithm within a commercial rdbms , using real-life data sets . our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our techniques .

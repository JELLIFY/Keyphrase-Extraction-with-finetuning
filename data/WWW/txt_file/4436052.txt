web services security configuration in a service-oriented architecture security is one of the major concerns when developing mission-critical business applications , and this concern motivated the web services security specifications . however , the existing tools to configure the security properties of web services give a technology-oriented view ; only assisting in choosing data to encrypt and the encryption algorithms to use . a user must manually bridge the gap between the security requirements and the configuration , which could cause extra configuration costs and lead to potential misconfiguration hazards . to ease this situation , we came up with refining security requirements from business to technology , leveraging the concepts of service-oriented architecture ( soa ) and model-driven architecture ( mda ) . security requirements are gradually transformed to more detailed ones or countermeasures by bridging the gap between them by using best practice patterns .

towards identifying arguments in wikipedia pages wikipedia is one of the most widely used repositories of human knowledge today , contributed mostly by a few hundred thousand regular editors . in this open environment , inevitably , differences of opinion arise among editors of the same article . especially for polemical topics such as religion and politics , difference of opinions among editors may lead to intense `` edit wars '' in which editors compete to have their opinions and points of view accepted . while such disputes can compromise the reliability of the article ( or at least portions of it ) , they are recorded in the edit history of the articles . we posit that exposing such disputes to the reader , and pointing to the portions of the text where they manifest most prominently can be beneficial in helping concerned readers in understanding such topics . in this paper , we discuss our initial efforts towards the problem of automatic evaluation of extracting controversial points in wikipedia pages .

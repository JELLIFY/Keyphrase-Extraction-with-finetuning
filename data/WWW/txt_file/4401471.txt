a probabilistic semantic approach for discovering web services service discovery is one of challenging issues in service-oriented computing . currently , most of the existing service discovering and matching approaches are based on keywords-based strategy . however , this method is inefficient and time-consuming . in this paper , we present a novel approach for discovering web services . based on the current dominating mechanisms of discovering and describing web services with uddi and wsdl , the proposed approach utilizes probabilistic latent semantic analysis ( plsa ) to capture semantic concepts hidden behind words in the query and advertisements in services so that services matching is expected to carry out at concept level . we also present related algorithms and preliminary experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach .

semi-automated adaptation of service interactions in today 's web , many functionality-wise similar web services are offered through heterogeneous interfaces ( operation definitions ) and business protocols ( ordering constraints defined on legal operation invocation sequences ) . the typical approach to enable interoperation in such a heterogeneous setting is through developing adapters . there have been approaches for classifying possible mismatches between service interfaces and business protocols to facilitate adapter development . however , the hard job is that of identifying , given two service specifications , the actual mismatches between their interfaces and business protocols . in this paper we present novel techniques and a tool that provides semi-automated support for identifying and resolution of mismatches between service interfaces and protocols , and for generating adapter specification . we make the following main contributions : ( i ) we identify mismatches between service interfaces , which leads to finding mismatches of type of signature , merge\/split , and extra\/missing messages ; ( ii ) we identify all ordering mismatches between service protocols and generate a tree , called mismatch tree , for mismatches that require developers ' input for their resolution . in addition , we provide semi-automated support in analyzing the mismatch tree to help in resolving such mismatches . we have implemented the approach in a tool inside ibm wid ( websphere integration developer ) . our experiments with some real-world case studies show the viability of the proposed approach . the methods and tool are significant in that they considerably simplify the problem of adapting services so that interoperation is possible .

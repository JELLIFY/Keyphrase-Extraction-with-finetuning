style mining of electronic messages for multiple authorship discrimination : first results this paper considers the use of computational stylistics for performing authorship attribution of electronic messages , addressing categorization problems with as many as 20 different classes ( authors ) . effective stylistic characterization of text is potentially useful for a variety of tasks , as language style contains cues regarding the authorship , purpose , and mood of the text , all of which would be useful adjuncts to information retrieval or knowledge-management tasks . we focus here on the problem of determining the author of an anonymous message , based only on the message text . several multiclass variants of the winnow algorithm were applied to a vector representation of the message texts to learn models for discriminating different authors . we present results comparing the classification accuracy of the different approaches . the results show that stylistic models can be accurately learned to determine an author 's identity .

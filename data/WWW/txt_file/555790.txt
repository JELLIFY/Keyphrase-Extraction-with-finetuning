crawling a country : better strategies than breadth-first for web page ordering this article compares several page ordering strategies for web crawling under several metrics . the objective of these strategies is to download the most `` important '' pages `` early '' during the crawl . as the coverage of modern search engines is small compared to the size of the web , and it is impossible to index all of the web for both theoretical and practical reasons , it is relevant to index at least the most important pages . we use data from actual web pages to build web graphs and execute a crawler simulator on those graphs . as the web is very dynamic , crawling simulation is the only way to ensure that all the strategies considered are compared under the same conditions . we propose several page ordering strategies that are more efficient than breadth - first search and strategies based on partial pagerank calculations .

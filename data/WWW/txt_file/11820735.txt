exploiting web search engines to search structured databases web search engines often federate many user queries to relevant structured databases . for example , a product related query might be federated to a product database containing their descriptions and specifications . the relevant structured data items are then returned to the user along with web search results . however , each structured database is searched in isolation . hence , the search often produces empty or incomplete results as the database may not contain the required information to answer the query . in this paper , we propose a novel integrated search architecture . we establish and exploit the relationships between web search results and the items in structured databases to identify the relevant structured data items for a much wider range of queries . our architecture leverages existing search engine components to implement this functionality at very low overhead . we demonstrate the quality and efficiency of our techniques through an extensive experimental study .

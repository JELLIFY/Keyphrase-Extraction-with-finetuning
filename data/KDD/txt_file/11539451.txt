neighbor query friendly compression of social networks compressing social networks can substantially facilitate mining and advanced analysis of large social networks . preferably , social networks should be compressed in a way that they still can be queried efficiently without decompression . arguably , neighbor queries , which search for all neighbors of a query vertex , are the most essential operations on social networks . can we compress social networks effectively in a neighbor query friendly manner , that is , neighbor queries still can be answered in sublinear time using the compression ? in this paper , we develop an effective social network compression approach achieved by a novel eulerian data structure using multi-position linearizations of directed graphs . our method comes with a nontrivial theoretical bound on the compression rate . to the best of our knowledge , our approach is the first that can answer both out-neighbor and in-neighbor queries in sublinear time . an extensive empirical study on more than a dozen benchmark real data sets verifies our design .

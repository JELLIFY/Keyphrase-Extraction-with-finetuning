efficient training on biased minimax probability machine for imbalanced text classification the biased minimax probability machine ( bmpm ) constructs a classifier which deals with the imbalanced learning tasks . in this paper , we propose a second order cone programming ( socp ) based algorithm to train the model . we outline the theoretical derivatives of the biased classification model , and address the text classification tasks where negative training documents significantly outnumber the positive ones using the proposed strategy . we evaluated the learning scheme in comparison with traditional solutions on three different datasets . empirical results have shown that our method is more effective and robust to handle imbalanced text classification problems .

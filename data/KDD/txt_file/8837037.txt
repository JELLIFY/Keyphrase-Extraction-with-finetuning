b-em : a classifier incorporating bootstrap with em approach for data mining this paper investigates the problem of augmenting labeled data with unlabeled data to improve classification accuracy . this is significant for many applications such as image classification where obtaining classification labels is expensive , while large unlabeled examples are easily available . we investigate an expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled data . the reason why unlabeled data boosts learning accuracy is because it provides the information about the joint probability distribution . a theoretical argument shows that the more unlabeled examples are combined in learning , the more accurate the result . we then introduce b-em algorithm , based on the combination of em with bootstrap method , to exploit the large unlabeled data while avoiding prohibitive i\/o cost . experimental results over both synthetic and real data sets that the proposed approach has a satisfactory performance .

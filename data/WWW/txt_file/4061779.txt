automatically learning document taxonomies for hierarchical classification while several hierarchical classification methods have been applied to web content , such techniques invariably rely on a pre-defined taxonomy of documents . we propose a new technique that extracts a suitable hierarchical structure automatically from a corpus of labeled documents . we show that our technique groups similar classes closer together in the tree and discovers relationships among documents that are not encoded in the class labels . the learned taxonomy is then used along with binary svms for multi-class classification . we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by testing it on the 20-newsgroup dataset .

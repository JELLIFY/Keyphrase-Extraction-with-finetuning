prive : anonymous location-based queries in distributed mobile systems nowadays , mobile users with global positioning devices canaccess location based services ( lbs ) and query about pointsof interest in their proximity . for such applications to succeed , privacy and confidentiality are essential . encryptionalone is not adequate ; although it safeguards the systemagainst eavesdroppers , the queries themselves may disclosethe location and identity of the user . recently , there havebeen proposed centralized architectures based on k-anonymity , which utilize an intermediate anonymizer between themobile users and the lbs . however , the anonymizer mustbe updated continuously with the current locations of allusers . moreover , the complete knowledge of the entire systemposes a security threat , if the anonymizer is compromised . in this paper we address two issues : ( i ) we show thatexisting approaches may fail to provide spatial anonymityfor some distributions of user locations and describe a noveltechnique which solves this problem . ( ii ) we propose prive , a decentralized architecture for preserving the anonymityof users issuing spatial queries to lbs . mobile users self-organizeinto an overlay network with good fault toleranceand load balancing properties . prive avoids the bottleneckcaused by centralized techniques both in terms of anonymizationand location updates . moreover , the system state isdistributed in numerous users , rendering prive resilient toattacks . extensive experimental studies suggest that priveis applicable to real-life scenarios with large populations ofmobile users .

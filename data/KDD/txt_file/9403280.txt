spotting out emerging artists using geo-aware analysis of p2p query strings record label companies would like to identify potential artists as early as possible in their careers , before other companies approach the artists with competing contracts . the vast number of candidates makes the process of identifying the ones with high success potential time consuming and laborious . this paper demonstrates how datamining of p2p query strings can be used in order to mechanize most of this detection process . using a unique intercepting system over the gnutella network , we were able to capture an unprecedented amount of geographically identified ( geo-aware ) queries , allowing us to investigate the diffusion of music related queries in time and space . our solution is based on the observation that emerging artists , especially rappers , have a discernible stronghold of fans in their hometown area , where they are able to perform and market their music . in a file sharing network , this is reflected as a delta function spatial distribution of content queries . using this observation , we devised a detection algorithm for emerging artists , that looks for performers with sharp increase in popularity in a small geographic region though still unnoticable nation wide . the algorithm can suggest a short list of artists with breakthrough potential , from which we showed that about 30 % translate the potential to national success .

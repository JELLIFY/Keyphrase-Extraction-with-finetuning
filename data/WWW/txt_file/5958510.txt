on admission control for profit maximization of networked service providers variability and diverseness among incoming requests to a service hosted on a finite capacity resource necessitates sophisticated request admission control techniques for providing guaranteed quality of service ( qos ) . we propose in this paper a service time based online admission control methodology for maximizing profits of a service provider . the proposed methodology chooses a subset of incoming requests such that the revenue of the provider is maximized . admission control decision in our proposed system is based upon an estimate of the service time of the request , qos bounds , prediction of arrivals and service times of requests to come in the short-term future , and rewards associated with servicing a request within its qos bounds . effectiveness of the proposed admission control methodology is demonstrated using experiments with a content-based messaging middleware service .

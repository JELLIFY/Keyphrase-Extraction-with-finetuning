accurate decision trees for mining high-speed data streams in this paper we study the problem of constructing accurate decision tree models from data streams . data streams are incremental tasks that require incremental , online , and any-time learning algorithms . one of the most successful algorithms for mining data streams is vfdt . in this paper we extend the vfdt system in two directions : the ability to deal with continuous data and the use of more powerful classification techniques at tree leaves . the proposed system , vfdtc , can incorporate and classify new information online , with a single scan of the data , in time constant per example . the most relevant property of our system is the ability to obtain a performance similar to a standard decision tree algorithm even for medium size datasets . this is relevant due to the any-time property . we study the behavior of vfdtc in different problems and demonstrate its utility in large and medium data sets . under a bias-variance analysis we observe that vfdtc in comparison to c4 .5 is able to reduce the variance component .

mining web logs for prediction models in www caching and prefetching web caching and prefetching are well known strategies for improving the performance of internet systems . when combined with web log mining , these strategies can decide to cache and prefetch web documents with higher accuracy . in this paper , we present an application of web log mining to obtain web-document access patterns and use these patterns to extend the well-known gdsf caching policies and prefetching policies . using real web logs , we show that this application of data mining can achieve dramatic improvement to web-access performance .

suppressing model overfitting in mining concept-drifting data streams mining data streams of changing class distributions is important for real-time business decision support . the stream classifier must evolve to reflect the current class distribution . this poses a serious challenge . on the one hand , relying on historical data may increase the chances of learning obsolete models . on the other hand , learning only from the latest data may lead to biased classifiers , as the latest data is often an unrepresentative sample of the current class distribution . the problem is particularly acute in classifying rare events , when , for example , instances of the rare class do not even show up in the most recent training data . in this paper , we use a stochastic model to describe the concept shifting patterns and formulate this problem as an optimization one : from the historical and the current training data that we have observed , find the most-likely current distribution , and learn a classifier based on the most-likely distribution . we derive an analytic solution and approximate this solution with an efficient algorithm , which calibrates the influence of historical data carefully to create an accurate classifier . we evaluate our algorithm with both synthetic and real-world datasets . our results show that our algorithm produces accurate and efficient classification .

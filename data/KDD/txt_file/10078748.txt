social influence analysis in large-scale networks in large social networks , nodes ( users , entities ) are influenced by others for various reasons . for example , the colleagues have strong influence on one 's work , while the friends have strong influence on one 's daily life . how to differentiate the social influences from different angles ( topics ) ? how to quantify the strength of those social influences ? how to estimate the model on real large networks ? to address these fundamental questions , we propose topical affinity propagation ( tap ) to model the topic-level social influence on large networks . in particular , tap can take results of any topic modeling and the existing network structure to perform topic-level influence propagation . with the help of the influence analysis , we present several important applications on real data sets such as 1 ) what are the representative nodes on a given topic ? 2 ) how to identify the social influences of neighboring nodes on a particular node ? to scale to real large networks , tap is designed with efficient distributed learning algorithms that is implemented and tested under the map-reduce framework . we further present the common characteristics of distributed learning algorithms for map-reduce . finally , we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of tap on real large data sets .

using d-gap patterns for index compression sequential patterns of d-gaps exist pervasively in inverted lists of web document collection indices due to the cluster property . in this paper the information of d-gap sequential patterns is used as a new dimension for improving inverted index compression . we first detect d-gap sequential patterns using a novel data structure , updown tree . based on the detected patterns , we further substitute each pattern with its pattern id in the inverted lists that contain it . the resulted inverted lists are then coded with an existing coding scheme . experiments show that this approach can effectively improve the compression ratio of existing codes .

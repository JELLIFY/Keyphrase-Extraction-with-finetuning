impact of search engines on page popularity recent studies show that a majority of web page accesses are referred by search engines . in this paper we study the widespread use of web search engines and its impact on the ecology of the web . in particular , we study how much impact search engines have on the popularity evolution of web pages . for example , given that search engines return currently popular '' pages at the top of search results , are we somehow penalizing newly created pages that are not very well known yet ? are popular pages getting even more popular and new pages completely ignored ? we first show that this unfortunate trend indeed exists on the web through an experimental study based on real web data . we then analytically estimate how much longer it takes for a new page to attract a large number of web users when search engines return only popular pages at the top of search results . our result shows that search engines can have an immensely worrisome impact on the discovery of new web pages .

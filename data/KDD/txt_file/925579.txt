application of kernels to link analysis the application of kernel methods to link analysis is explored . in particular , kandola et al. 's neumann kernels are shown to subsume not only the co-citation and bibliographic coupling relatedness but also kleinberg 's hits importance . these popular measures of relatedness and importance correspond to the neumann kernels at the extremes of their parameter range , and hence these kernels can be interpreted as defining a spectrum of link analysis measures intermediate between co-citation\/bibliographic coupling and hits . we also show that the kernels based on the graph laplacian , including the regularized laplacian and diffusion kernels , provide relatedness measures that overcome some limitations of co-citation relatedness . the property of these kernel-based link analysis measures is examined with a network of bibliographic citations . practical issues in applying these methods to real data are discussed , and possible solutions are proposed .

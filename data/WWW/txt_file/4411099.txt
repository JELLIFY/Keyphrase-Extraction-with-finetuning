association search in semantic web : search + inference association search is to search for certain instances in semantic web and then make inferences from and about the instances we have found . in this paper , we propose the problem of association search and our preliminary solution for it using bayesian network . we first minutely define the association search and its categorization . we then define tasks in association search . in terms of bayesian network , we take ontology taxonomy as network structure in bayesian network . we use the query log of instances to estimate the network parameters . after the bayesian network is constructed , we give the solution for association search in the network .

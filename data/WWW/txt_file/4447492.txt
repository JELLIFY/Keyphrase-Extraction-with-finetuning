a semantic-link-based infrastructure for web service discovery in p2p networks an important issue arising from p2p applications is how to accurately and efficiently retrieve the required web services from large-scale repositories . this paper resolves this issue by organizing services in the overlay combining the semantic service link network and the chord p2p network . a service request will first be routed in the chord according to the given service operation names and keywords . then , the same request will be routed in the semantic link network according to the service link type and semantic matching . compared with previous p2p service discovery approaches , the proposed approach has two advantages : ( 1 ) produce more accurate and meaning results when searching for particular services in a p2p network ; and ( 2 ) enable users and peers to discover services in a more flexible way .

evolutionary spectral clustering by incorporating temporal smoothness evolutionary clustering is an emerging research area essential to important applications such as clustering dynamic web and blog contents and clustering data streams . in evolutionary clustering , a good clustering result should fit the current data well , while simultaneously not deviate too dramatically from the recent history . to fulfill this dual purpose , a measure of temporal smoothness is integrated in the overall measure of clustering quality . in this paper , we propose two frameworks that incorporate temporal smoothness in evolutionary spectral clustering . for both frameworks , we start with intuitions gained from the well-known k-means clustering problem , and then propose and solve corresponding cost functions for the evolutionary spectral clustering problems . our solutions to the evolutionary spectral clustering problems provide more stable and consistent clustering results that are less sensitive to short-term noises while at the same time are adaptive to long-term cluster drifts . furthermore , we demonstrate that our methods provide the optimal solutions to the relaxed versions of the corresponding evolutionary k-means clustering problems . performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate our evolutionary spectral clustering methods provide more robust clustering results that are not sensitive to noise and can adapt to data drifts .

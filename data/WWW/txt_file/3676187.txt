a comparison of implicit and explicit links for web page classification it is well known that web-page classification can be enhanced by using hyperlinks that provide linkages between web pages . however , in the web space , hyperlinks are usually sparse , noisy and thus in many situations can only provide limited help in classification . in this paper , we extend the concept of linkages from explicit hyperlinks to implicit links built between web pages . by observing that people who search the web with the same queries often click on different , but related documents together , we draw implicit links between web pages that are clicked after the same queries . those pages are implicitly linked . we provide an approach for automatically building the implicit links between web pages using web query logs , together with a thorough comparison between the uses of implicit and explicit links in web page classification . our experimental results on a large dataset confirm that the use of the implicit links is better than using explicit links in classification performance , with an increase of more than 10.5 % in terms of the macro-f1 measurement .

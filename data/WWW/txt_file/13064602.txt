conquer : a system for efficient context-aware query suggestions many of today 's search engines provide autocompletion while the user is typing a query string . this type of dynamic query suggestion can help users to formulate queries that better represent their search intent during web search interactions . in this paper , we demonstrate our query suggestion system called conquer , which allows to efficiently suggest queries for a given partial query and a number of available query context observations . the context-awareness allows for suggesting queries tailored to a given context , e.g. , the user location or the time of day . conquer uses a suggestion model that is based on the combined probabilities of sequential query patterns and context observations . for this , the weight of a context in a query suggestion can be adjusted online , for example , based on the learned user behavior or user profiles . we demonstrate the functionality of conquer based on 6 million queries from an aol query log using the time of day and the country domain of the clicked urls in the search result as context observations .

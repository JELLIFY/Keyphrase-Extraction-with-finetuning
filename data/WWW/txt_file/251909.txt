accessibility : a web engineering approach currently , the vast majority of web sites do not support accessibility for visually impaired users . usually , these users have to rely on screen readers : applications that sequentially read the content of a web page in audio . unfortunately , screen readers are not able to detect the meaning of the different page objects , and thus the implicit semantic knowledge conveyed in the presentation of the page is lost . one approach described in literature to tackle this problem , is the dante approach , which allows semantic annotation of web pages to provide screen readers with extra ( semantic ) knowledge to better facilitate the audio presentation of a web page . until now , such annotations were done manually , and failed for dynamic pages . in this paper , we combine the dante approach with a web design method , wsdm , to fully automate the generation of the semantic annotation for visually impaired users . to do so , the semantic knowledge gathered during the design process is exploited , and the annotations are generated as a by-product of the design process , requiring no extra effort from the designer .

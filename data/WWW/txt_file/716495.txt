agent-based semantic web services the web services world consists of loosely-coupled distributed systems which adapt to ad-hoc changes by the use of service descriptions that enable opportunistic service discovery . at present , these service descriptions are semantically impoverished , being concerned with describing the functional signature of the services rather than characterising their meaning . in the semantic web community , the daml services effort attempts to rectify this by providing a more expressive way of describing web services using ontologies . however , this approach does not separate the domain-neutral communicative intent of a message ( considered in terms of speech acts ) from its domain-specific content , unlike similar developments from the multi-agent systems community . in this paper , we describe our experiences of designing and building an ontologically motivated web services system for situational awareness and information triage in a simulated humanitarian aid scenario . in particular , we discuss the merits of using techniques from the multi-agent systems community for separating the intentional force of messages from their content , and the implementation of these techniques within the daml services model .

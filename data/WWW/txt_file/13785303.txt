simplifying friendlist management online social networks like facebook allow users to connect , communicate , and share content . the popularity of these services has lead to an information overload for their users ; the task of simply keeping track of different interactions has become daunting . to reduce this burden , sites like facebook allows the user to group friends into specific lists , known as friendlists , aggregating the interactions and content from all friends in each friendlist . while this approach greatly reduces the burden on the user , it still forces the user to create and populate the friendlists themselves and , worse , makes the user responsible for maintaining the membership of their friendlists over time . we show that friendlists often have a strong correspondence to the structure of the social network , implying that friendlists may be automatically inferred by leveraging the social network structure . we present a demonstration of friendlist manager , a facebook application that proposes friendlists to the user based on the structure of their local social network , allows the user to tweak the proposed friendlists , and then automatically creates the friendlists for the user .

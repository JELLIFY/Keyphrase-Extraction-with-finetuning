combining global optimization with local selection for efficient qos-aware service composition the run-time binding of web services has been recently put forward in order to support rapid and dynamic web service compositions . with the growing number of alternative web services that provide the same functionality but differ in quality parameters , the service composition becomes a decision problem on which component services should be selected such that user 's end-to-end qos requirements ( e.g. availability , response time ) and preferences ( e.g. price ) are satisfied . although very efficient , local selection strategy fails short in handling global qos requirements . solutions based on global optimization , on the other hand , can handle global constraints , but their poor performance renders them inappropriate for applications with dynamic and real-time requirements . in this paper we address this problem and propose a solution that combines global optimization with local selection techniques to benefit from the advantages of both worlds . the proposed solution consists of two steps : first , we use mixed integer programming ( mip ) to find the optimal decomposition of global qos constraints into local constraints . second , we use distributed local selection to find the best web services that satisfy these local constraints . the results of experimental evaluation indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of computation time while achieving close-to-optimal results .

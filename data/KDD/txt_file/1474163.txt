ensemble-index : a new approach to indexing large databases the problem of similarity search ( query-by-content ) has attracted much research interest . it is a difficult problem because of the inherently high dimensionality of the data . the most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data , then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure . many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed , including singular value decomposition ( svd ) , the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) and piecewise polynomial approximation . in this work , we introduce a novel framework for using ensembles of two or more representations for more efficient indexing . the basic idea is that instead of committing to a single representation for an entire dataset , different representations are chosen for indexing different parts of the database . the representations are chosen based upon a local view of the database . for example , sections of the data that can achieve a high fidelity representation with wavelets are indexed as wavelets , but highly spectral sections of the data are indexed using the fourier transform . at query time , it is necessary to search several small heterogeneous indices , rather than one large homogeneous index . as we will theoretically and empirically demonstrate this results in much faster query response times .

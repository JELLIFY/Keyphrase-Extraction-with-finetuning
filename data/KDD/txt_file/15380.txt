web usage mining based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis the primary goal of web usage mining is the discovery of patterns in the navigational behavior of web users . standard approaches , such as clustering of user sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths , do not generally provide the ability to automatically characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that lead to common navigational patterns . it is , therefore , necessary to develop techniques that can automatically discover hidden semantic relationships among users as well as between users and web objects . probabilistic latent semantic analysis ( plsa ) is particularly useful in this context , since it can uncover latent semantic associations among users and pages based on the co-occurrence patterns of these pages in user sessions . in this paper , we develop a unified framework for the discovery and analysis of web navigational patterns based on plsa . we show the flexibility of this framework in characterizing various relationships among users and web objects . since these relationships are measured in terms of probabilities , we are able to use probabilistic inference to perform a variety of analysis tasks such as user segmentation , page classification , as well as predictive tasks such as collaborative recommendations . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments performed on real-world data sets .

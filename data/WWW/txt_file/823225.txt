a combined approach to checking web ontologies the understanding of semantic web documents is built upon ontologies that define concepts and relationships of data . hence , the correctness of ontologies is vital . ontology reasoners such as racer and fact have been developed to reason ontologies with a high degree of automation . however , complex ontology-related properties may not be expressible within the current web ontology languages , consequently they may not be checkable by racer and fact . we propose to use the software engineering techniques and tools , i.e. , z\/eves and alloy analyzer , to complement the ontology tools for checking semantic web documents . in this approach , z\/eves is first applied to remove trivial syntax and type errors of the ontologies . next , racer is used to identify any ontological inconsistencies , whose origins can be traced by alloy analyzer . finally z\/eves is used again to express complex ontology-related properties and reveal errors beyond the modeling capabilities of the current web ontology languages . we have successfully applied this approach to checking a set of military plan ontologies .

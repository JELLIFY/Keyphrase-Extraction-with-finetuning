fast approximate spectral clustering spectral clustering refers to a flexible class of clustering procedures that can produce high-quality clusterings on small data sets but which has limited applicability to large-scale problems due to its computational complexity of o ( n3 ) in general , with n the number of data points . we extend the range of spectral clustering by developing a general framework for fast approximate spectral clustering in which a distortion-minimizing local transformation is first applied to the data . this framework is based on a theoretical analysis that provides a statistical characterization of the effect of local distortion on the mis-clustering rate . we develop two concrete instances of our general framework , one based on local k-means clustering ( kasp ) and one based on random projection trees ( rasp ) . extensive experiments show that these algorithms can achieve significant speedups with little degradation in clustering accuracy . specifically , our algorithms outperform k-means by a large margin in terms of accuracy , and run several times faster than approximate spectral clustering based on the nystrom method , with comparable accuracy and significantly smaller memory footprint . remarkably , our algorithms make it possible for a single machine to spectral cluster data sets with a million observations within several minutes .

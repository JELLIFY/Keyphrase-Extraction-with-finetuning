a data-driven sketch of wikipedia editors who edits wikipedia ? we attempt to shed light on this question by using aggregated log data from yahoo ! 's browser toolbar in order to analyze wikipedians ' editing behavior in the context of their online lives beyond wikipedia . we broadly characterize editors by investigating how their online behavior differs from that of other users ; e.g. , we find that wikipedia editors search more , read more news , play more games , and , perhaps surprisingly , are more immersed in pop culture . then we inspect how editors ' general interests relate to the articles to which they contribute ; e.g. , we confirm the intuition that editors show more expertise in their active domains than average users . our results are relevant as they illuminate novel aspects of what has become many web users ' prevalent source of information and can help in recruiting new editors .

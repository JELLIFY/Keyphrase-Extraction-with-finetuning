a foundation for tool based mobility support for visually impaired web users users make journeys through the web . web travel encompasses the tasks of orientation and navigation , the environment and the purpose of the journey . the ease of travel , its mobility , varies from page to page and site to site . for visually impaired users , in particular , mobility is reduced ; the objects that support travel are inaccessible or missing altogether . web development tools need to include support to increase mobility . we present a framework for finding and classifying travel objects within web pages . the evaluation carried out has shown that this framework supports a systematic and consistent method for assessing travel upon the web . we propose that such a framework can provide the foundation for a semi-automated tool for the support of travel upon the web .

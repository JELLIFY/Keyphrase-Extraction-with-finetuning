constant-factor approximation algorithms for identifying dynamic communities we propose two approximation algorithms for identifying communities in dynamic social networks . communities are intuitively characterized as `` unusually densely knit '' subsets of a social network . this notion becomes more problematic if the social interactions change over time . aggregating social networks over time can radically misrepresent the existing and changing community structure . recently , we have proposed an optimization-based framework for modeling dynamic community structure . also , we have proposed an algorithm for finding such structure based on maximum weight bipartite matching . in this paper , we analyze its performance guarantee for a special case where all actors can be observed at all times . in such instances , we show that the algorithm is a small constant factor approximation of the optimum . we use a similar idea to design an approximation algorithm for the general case where some individuals are possibly unobserved at times , and to show that the approximation factor increases twofold but remains a constant regardless of the input size . this is the first algorithm for inferring communities in dynamic networks with a provable approximation guarantee . we demonstrate the general algorithm on real data sets . the results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in identifying dynamic communities .

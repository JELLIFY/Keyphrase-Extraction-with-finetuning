isax : indexing and mining terabyte sized time series current research in indexing and mining time series data has produced many interesting algorithms and representations . however , the algorithms and the size of data considered have generally not been representative of the increasingly massive datasets encountered in science , engineering , and business domains . in this work , we show how a novel multi-resolution symbolic representation can be used to index datasets which are several orders of magnitude larger than anything else considered in the literature . our approach allows both fast exact search and ultra fast approximate search . we show how to exploit the combination of both types of search as sub-routines in data mining algorithms , allowing for the exact mining of truly massive real world datasets , containing millions of time series .

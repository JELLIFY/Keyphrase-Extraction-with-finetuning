xj : facilitating xml processing in java the increased importance of xml as a data representation format has led to several proposals for facilitating the development of applications that operate on xml data . these proposals range from runtime api-based interfaces to xml-based programming languages . the subject of this paper is xj , a research language that proposes novel mechanisms for the integration of xml as a first-class construct into java â„¢ . the design goals of xj distinguish it from past work on integrating xml support into programming languages -- specifically , the xj design adheres to the xml schema and xpath standards . moreover , it supports in-place updates of xml data thereby keeping with the imperative nature of java . we have built a prototype compiler for xj , and our preliminary experiments demonstrate that the performance of xj programs can approach that of traditional low-level api-based interfaces , while providing a higher level of abstraction .

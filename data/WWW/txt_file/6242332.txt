supporting end-users in the creation of dependable web clips web authoring environments enable end-users to create applications that integrate information from other web sources . users can create web sites that include built-in components to dynamically incorporate , for example , weather information , stock-quotes , or the latest news from different web sources . recent surveys conducted among end-users have indicated an increasing interest in creating such applications . unfortunately , web authoring environments do not provide support beyond a limited set of built-in components . this work addresses this limitation by providing end-user support for `` clipping '' information from a target web site to incorporate it into the end-user site . the support consists of a mechanism to identify the target clipping with multiple markers to increase robustness , and a dynamic assessment of the retrieved information to quantify its reliability . the clipping approach has been integrated as a feature into a popular web authoring tool on which we present the results of two preliminary studies .

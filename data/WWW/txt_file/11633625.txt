automated object persistence for javascript traditionally web applications have required an internet connection in order to work with data . browsers have lacked any mechanisms to allow web applications to operate offline with a set of data to provide constant access to applications . recently , through browser plug-ins such as google gears , browsers have gained the ability to persist data for offline use . however , until now it 's been difficult for a web developer using these plug-ins to manage persisting data both locally for offline use and in the internet cloud due to : synchronization requirements , managing throughput and latency to the cloud , and making it work within the confines of a standards-compliant web browser . historically in non-browser environments , programming language environments have offered automated object persistence to shield the developer from these complexities . in our research we have created a framework which introduces automated persistence of data objects for javascript utilizing the internet . unlike traditional object persistence solutions , ours relies only on existing or forthcoming internet standards and does not rely upon specific runtime mechanisms such as os or interpreter\/compiler support . a new design was required in order to be suitable to the internet 's unique characteristics of varying connection quality and a browser 's specific restrictions . we validate our approach using benchmarks which show that our framework can handle thousands of data objects automatically , reducing the amount of work needed by developers to support offline web applications .

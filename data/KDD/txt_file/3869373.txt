the data mining approach to automated software testing in today 's industry , the design of software tests is mostly based on the testers ' expertise , while test automation tools are limited to execution of pre-planned tests only . evaluation of test outputs is also associated with a considerable effort by human testers who often have imperfect knowledge of the requirements specification . not surprisingly , this manual approach to software testing results in heavy losses to the world 's economy . the costs of the so-called `` catastrophic '' software failures ( such as mars polar lander shutdown in 1999 ) are even hard to measure . in this paper , we demonstrate the potential use of data mining algorithms for automated induction of functional requirements from execution data . the induced data mining models of tested software can be utilized for recovering missing and incomplete specifications , designing a minimal set of regression tests , and evaluating the correctness of software outputs when testing new , potentially flawed releases of the system . to study the feasibility of the proposed approach , we have applied a novel data mining algorithm called info-fuzzy network ( ifn ) to execution data of a general-purpose code for solving partial differential equations . after being trained on a relatively small number of randomly generated input-output examples , the model constructed by the ifn algorithm has shown a clear capability to discriminate between correct and faulty versions of the program .

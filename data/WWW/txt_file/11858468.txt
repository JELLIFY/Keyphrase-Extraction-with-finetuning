we . b : the web of short urls short urls have become ubiquitous . especially popular within social networking services , short urls have seen a significant increase in their usage over the past years , mostly due to twitter 's restriction of message length to 140 characters . in this paper , we provide a first characterization on the usage of short urls . specifically , our goal is to examine the content short urls point to , how they are published , their popularity and activity over time , as well as their potential impact on the performance of the web . our study is based on traces of short urls as seen from two different perspectives : i ) collected through a large-scale crawl of url shortening services , and ii ) collected by crawling twitter messages . the former provides a general characterization on the usage of short urls , while the latter provides a more focused view on how certain communities use shortening services . our analysis highlights that domain and website popularity , as seen from short urls , significantly differs from the distributions provided by well publicised services such as alexa . the set of most popular websites pointed to by short urls appears stable over time , despite the fact that short urls have a limited high popularity lifetime . surprisingly short urls are not ephemeral , as a significant fraction , roughly 50 % , appears active for more than three months . overall , our study emphasizes the fact that short urls reflect an `` alternative '' web and , hence , provide an additional view on web usage and content consumption complementing traditional measurement sources . furthermore , our study reveals the need for alternative shortening architectures that will eliminate the non-negligible performance penalty imposed by today 's shortening services .

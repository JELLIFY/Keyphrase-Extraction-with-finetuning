measuring and extracting proximity in networks measuring distance or some other form of proximity between objects is a standard data mining tool . connection subgraphs were recently proposed as a way to demonstrate proximity between nodes in networks . we propose a new way of measuring and extracting proximity in networks called `` cycle free effective conductance '' ( cfec ) . our proximity measure can handle more than two endpoints , directed edges , is statistically well-behaved , and produces an effectiveness score for the computed subgraphs . we provide an efficien talgorithm . also , we report experimental results and show examples for three large network data sets : a telecommunications calling graph , the imdb actors graph , and an academic co-authorship network .

mining newsgroups using networks arising from social behavior recent advances in information retrieval over hyperlinked corpora have convincingly demonstrated that links carry less noisy information than text . we investigate the feasibility of applying link-based methods in new applications domains . the specific application we consider is to partition authors into opposite camps within a given topic in the context of newsgroups . a typical newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author . this social behavior gives rise to a network in which the vertices are individuals and the links represent `` responded-to '' relationships . an interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a message when they disagree than when they agree . this behavior is in sharp contrast to the www link graph , where linkage is an indicator of agreement or common interest . by analyzing the graph structure of the responses , we are able to effectively classify people into opposite camps . in contrast , methods based on statistical analysis of text yield low accuracy on such datasets because the vocabulary used by the two sides tends to be largely identical , and many newsgroup postings consist of relatively few words of text .

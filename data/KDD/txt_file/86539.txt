screening and interpreting multi-item associations based on log-linear modeling association rules have received a lot of attention in the data mining community since their introduction . the classical approach to find rules whose items enjoy high support ( appear in a lot of the transactions in the data set ) is , however , filled with shortcomings . it has been shown that support can be misleading as an indicator of how interesting the rule is . alternative measures , such as lift , have been proposed . more recently , a paper by dumouchel et al. proposed the use of all-two-factor loglinear models to discover sets of items that can not be explained by pairwise associations between the items involved . this approach , however , has its limitations , since it stops short of considering higher order interactions ( other than pairwise ) among the items . in this paper , we propose a method that examines the parameters of the fitted loglinear models to find all the significant association patterns among the items . since fitting loglinear models for large data sets can be computationally prohibitive , we apply graph-theoretical results to divide the original set of items into components ( sets of items ) that are statistically independent from each other . we then apply loglinear modeling to each of the components and find the interesting associations among items in them . the technique is experimentally evaluated with a real data set ( insurance data ) and a series of synthetic data sets . the results show that the technique is effective in finding interesting associations among the items involved .

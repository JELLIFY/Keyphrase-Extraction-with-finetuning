mr. lda : a flexible large scale topic modeling package using variational inference in mapreduce latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) is a popular topic modeling technique for exploring document collections . because of the increasing prevalence of large datasets , there is a need to improve the scalability of inference for lda . in this paper , we introduce a novel and flexible large scale topic modeling package in mapreduce ( mr. lda ) . as opposed to other techniques which use gibbs sampling , our proposed framework uses variational inference , which easily fits into a distributed environment . more importantly , this variational implementation , unlike highly tuned and specialized implementations based on gibbs sampling , is easily extensible . we demonstrate two extensions of the models possible with this scalable framework : informed priors to guide topic discovery and extracting topics from a multilingual corpus . we compare the scalability of mr. lda against mahout , an existing large scale topic modeling package . mr. lda out-performs mahout both in execution speed and held-out likelihood .

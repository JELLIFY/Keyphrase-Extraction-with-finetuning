correlating synchronous and asynchronous data streams in a variety of modern mining applications , data are commonly viewed as infinite time ordered data streams rather as finite data sets stored on disk . this view challenges fundamental assumptions commonly made in the context of several data mining algorithms . in this paper , we study the problem of identifying correlations between multiple data streams . in particular , we propose algorithms capable of capturing correlations between multiple continuous data streams in a highly efficient and accurate manner . our algorithms and techniques are applicable in the case of both synchronous and asynchronous data streaming environments . we capture correlations between multiple streams using the well known technique of singular value decomposition ( svd ) . correlations between data items , and the svd technique in particular , have been repeatedly utilized in an off-line ( non stream ) data mining problems , for example forecasting , approximate query answering , and data reduction . we propose a methodology based on a combination of dimensionality reduction and sampling to make the svd technique suitable for a data stream context . our techniques are approximate , trading accuracy with performance , and we analytically quantify this tradeoff . we present a through experimental evaluation , using both real and synthetic data sets , from a prototype implementation of our technique , investigating the impact of various parameters in the accuracy of the overall computation . our results indicate , that correlations between multiple data streams can be identified very efficiently and accurately . the algorithms proposed herein , are presented as generic tools , with a multitude of applications on data stream mining problems .

sampling-based sequential subgroup mining subgroup discovery is a learning task that aims at finding interesting rules from classified examples . the search is guided by a utility function , trading off the coverage of rules against their statistical unusualness . one shortcoming of existing approaches is that they do not incorporate prior knowledge . to this end a novel generic sampling strategy is proposed . it allows to turn pattern mining into an iterative process . in each iteration the focus of subgroup discovery lies on those patterns that are unexpected with respect to prior knowledge and previously discovered patterns . the result of this technique is a small diverse set of understandable rules that characterise a specified property of interest . as another contribution this article derives a simple connection between subgroup discovery and classifier induction . for a popular utility function this connection allows to apply any standard rule induction algorithm to the task of subgroup discovery after a step of stratified resampling . the proposed techniques are empirically compared to state of the art subgroup discovery algorithms .

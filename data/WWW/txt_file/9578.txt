dom-based content extraction of html documents web pages often contain clutter ( such as pop-up ads , unnecessary images and extraneous links ) around the body of an article that distracts a user from actual content . extraction of `` useful and relevant '' content from web pages has many applications , including cell phone and pda browsing , speech rendering for the visually impaired , and text summarization . most approaches to removing clutter or making content more readable involve changing font size or removing html and data components such as images , which takes away from a webpage 's inherent look and feel . unlike `` content reformatting '' , which aims to reproduce the entire webpage in a more convenient form , our solution directly addresses `` content extraction '' . we have developed a framework that employs easily extensible set of techniques that incorporate advantages of previous work on content extraction . our key insight is to work with the dom trees , rather than with raw html markup . we have implemented our approach in a publicly available web proxy to extract content from html web pages .

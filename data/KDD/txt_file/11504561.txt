parallel computation of high dimensional robust correlation and covariance matrices the computation of covariance and correlation matrices are critical to many data mining applications and processes . unfortunately the classical covariance and correlation matrices are very sensitive to outliers . robust methods , such as qc and the maronna method , have been proposed . however , existing algorithms for qc only give acceptable performance when the dimensionality of the matrix is in the hundreds ; and the maronna method is rarely used in practice because of its high computational cost . in this paper , we develop parallel algorithms for both qc and the maronna method . we evaluate these parallel algorithms using a real data set of the gene expression of over 6,000 genes , giving rise to a matrix of over 18 million entries . in our experimental evaluation , we explore scalability in dimensionality and in the number of processors . we also compare the parallel behaviors of the two methods . after thorough experimentation , we conclude that for many data mining applications , both qc and maronna are viable options . less robust , but faster , qc is the recommended choice for small parallel platforms . on the other hand , the maronna method is the recommended choice when a high degree of robustness is required , or when the parallel platform features a high number of processors .

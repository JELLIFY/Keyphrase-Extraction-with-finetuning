improving pseudo-relevance feedback in web information retrieval using web page segmentation in contrast to traditional document retrieval , a web page as a whole is not a good information unit to search because it often contains multiple topics and a lot of irrelevant information from navigation , decoration , and interaction part of the page . in this paper , we propose a vision-based page segmentation ( vips ) algorithm to detect the semantic content structure in a web page . compared with simple dom based segmentation method , our page segmentation scheme utilizes useful visual cues to obtain a better partition of a page at the semantic level . by using our vips algorithm to assist the selection of query expansion terms in pseudo-relevance feedback in web information retrieval , we achieve 27 % performance improvement on web track dataset .

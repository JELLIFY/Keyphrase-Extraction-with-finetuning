selective early request termination for busy internet services internet traffic is bursty and network servers are often overloaded with surprising events or abnormal client request patterns . this paper studies a load shedding mechanism called selective early request termination ( sert ) for network services that use threads to handle multiple incoming requests continuously and concurrently . our investigation with applications from ask.com shows that during overloaded situations , a relatively small percentage of long requests that require excessive computing resource can dramatically affect other short requests and reduce the overall system throughput . by actively detecting and aborting overdue long requests , services can perform significantly better to achieve qos objectives compared to a purely admission based approach . we have proposed a termination scheme that monitors running time of requests , accounts for their resource usage , adaptively adjusts the selection threshold , and performs a safe termination for a class of requests . this paper presents the design and implementation of this scheme and describes experimental results to validate the proposed approach .

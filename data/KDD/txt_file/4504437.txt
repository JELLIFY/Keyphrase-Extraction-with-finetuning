finding similar files in large document repositories hewlett-packard has many millions of technical support documents in a variety of collections . as part of content management , such collections are periodically merged and groomed . in the process , it becomes important to identify and weed out support documents that are largely duplicates of newer versions . doing so improves the quality of the collection , eliminates chaff from search results , and improves customer satisfaction . the technical challenge is that through workflow and human processes , the knowledge of which documents are related is often lost . we required a method that could identify similar documents based on their content alone , without relying on metadata , which may be corrupt or missing . we present an approach for finding similar files that scales up to large document repositories . it is based on chunking the byte stream to find unique signatures that may be shared in multiple files . an analysis of the file-chunk graph yields clusters of related files . an optional bipartite graph partitioning algorithm can be applied to greatly increase scalability .

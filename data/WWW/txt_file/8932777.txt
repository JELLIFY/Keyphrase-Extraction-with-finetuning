hearsay : enabling audio browsing on hypertext content in this paper we present hearsay , a system for browsing hypertext web documents via audio . the hearsay system is based on our novel approach to automatically creating audio browsable content from hypertext web documents . it combines two key technologies : ( 1 ) automatic partitioning of web documents through tightly coupled structural and semantic analysis , which transforms raw html documents into semantic structures so as to facilitate audio browsing ; and ( 2 ) voicexml , an already standardized technology which we adopt to represent voice dialogs automatically created from the xml output of partitioning . this paper describes the software components of hearsay and presents an initial system evaluation .

augmenting the generalized hough transform to enable the mining of petroglyphs rock art is an archaeological term for human-made markings on stone . it is believed that there are millions of petroglyphs in north america alone , and the study of this valued cultural resource has implications even beyond anthropology and history . surprisingly , although image processing , information retrieval and data mining have had large impacts on many human endeavors , they have had essentially zero impact on the study of rock art . in this work we identify the reasons for this , and introduce a novel distance measure and algorithms which allow efficient and effective data mining of large collections of rock art .

web image retrieval reranking with multi-view clustering general image retrieval is often carried out by a text-based search engine , such as google image search . in this case , natural language queries are used as input to the search engine . usually , the user queries are quite ambiguous and the returned results are not well-organized as the ranking often done by the popularity of an image . in order to address these problems , we propose to use both textual and visual contents of retrieved images to rerank web retrieved results . in particular , a machine learning technique , a multi-view clustering algorithm is proposed to reorganize the original results provided by the text-based search engine . preliminary results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework .

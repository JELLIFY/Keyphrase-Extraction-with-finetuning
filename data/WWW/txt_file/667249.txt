a fast xpath evaluation technique with the facility of updates this paper addresses the problem of fast retrieval of data from xml documents by providing a labeling schema that can easily handle simple as well as complex xpath queries and also provide for updates without the need for the entire document being re-indexed in the rdbms . we introduce a new labeling schema called the `` z-label '' for efficiently processing xpath queries involving child and descendant axes . the use of `` z-label '' coupled with the indexing schema provides for smooth updates in the xml document .

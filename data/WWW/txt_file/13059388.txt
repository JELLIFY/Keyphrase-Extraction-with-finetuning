standing on the shoulders of ants : stigmergy in the web stigmergy is a biological term used when discussing insect or swarm behavior , and describes a model supporting environmental communication separately from artefacts or agents . this phenomenon is demonstrated in the behavior of ants and their food gathering process when following pheromone trails , or similarly termites and their termite mound building process . what is interesting with this mechanism is that highly organized societies are achieved without an apparent management structure . stigmergic behavior is implicit in the web where the volume of users provides a self-organizing and self-contextualization of content in sites which facilitate collaboration . however , the majority of content is generated by a minority of the web participants . a significant contribution from this research would be to create a model of web stigmergy , identifying virtual pheromones and their importance in the collaborative process . this paper explores how exploiting stigmergy has the potential of providing a valuable mechanism for identifying and analyzing online user behavior recording actionable knowledge otherwise lost in the existing web interaction dynamics . ultimately this might assist our building better collaborative web sites .

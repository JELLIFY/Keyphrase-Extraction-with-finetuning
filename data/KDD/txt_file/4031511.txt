mining optimal decision trees from itemset lattices we present dl8 , an exact algorithm for finding a decision tree that optimizes a ranking function under size , depth , accuracy and leaf constraints . because the discovery of optimal trees has high theoretical complexity , until now few efforts have been made to compute such trees for real-world datasets . an exact algorithm is of both scientific and practical interest . from a scientific point of view , it can be used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of heuristic constraint-based decision tree learners and to gain new insight in traditional decision tree learners . from the application point of view , it can be used to discover trees that can not be found by heuristic decision tree learners . the key idea behind our algorithm is that there is a relation between constraints on decision trees and constraints on itemsets . we show that optimal decision trees can be extracted from lattices of itemsets in linear time . we give several strategies to efficiently build these lattices . experiments show that under the same constraints , dl8 obtains better results than c4 .5 , which confirms that exhaustive search does not always imply overfitting . the results also show that dl8 is a useful and interesting tool to learn decision trees under constraints .

a framework for xml data streams history checking and monitoring the need of formal verification is a problem that involves all the fields in which sensible data are managed . in this context the verification of data streams became a fundamental task . the purpose of this paper is to present a framework , based on the model checker spin , for the verification of data streams . the proposed method uses a linear temporal logic , called trio , to describe data constraints and properties . constraints are automatically translated into promela , the input language of the model checker spin in order to verify them .

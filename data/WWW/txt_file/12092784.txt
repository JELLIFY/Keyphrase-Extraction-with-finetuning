efficiently querying rdf data in triple stores efficiently querying rdf data is being an important factor in applying semantic web technologies to real-world applications . in this context , many efforts have been made to store and query rdf data in relational database using particular schemas . in this paper , we propose a new scheme to store , index , and query rdf data in triple stores . graph feature of rdf data is taken into considerations which might help reduce the join costs on the vertical database structure . we would partition rdf triples into overlapped groups , store them in a triple table with one more column of group identity , and build up a signature tree to index them . based on this infrastructure , a complex rdf query is decomposed into multiple pieces of sub-queries which could be easily filtered into some rdf groups using signature tree index , and finally is evaluated with a composed and optimized sql with specific constraints . we compare the performance of our method with prior art on typical queries over a large scaled lubm and uobm benchmark data ( more than 10 million triples ) . for some extreme cases , they can promote 3 to 4 orders of magnitude .

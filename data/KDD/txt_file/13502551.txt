a generalized co-hits algorithm and its application to bipartite graphs recently many data types arising from data mining and web search applications can be modeled as bipartite graphs . examples include queries and urls in query logs , and authors and papers in scientific literature . however , one of the issues is that previous algorithms only consider the content and link information from one side of the bipartite graph . there is a lack of constraints to make sure the final relevance of the score propagation on the graph , as there are many noisy edges within the bipartite graph . in this paper , we propose a novel and general co-hits algorithm to incorporate the bipartite graph with the content information from both sides as well as the constraints of relevance . moreover , we investigate the algorithm based on two frameworks , including the iterative and the regularization frameworks , and illustrate the generalized co-hits algorithm from different views . for the iterative framework , it contains hits and personalized pagerank as special cases . in the regularization framework , we successfully build a connection with hits , and develop a new cost function to consider the direct relationship between two entity sets , which leads to a significant improvement over the baseline method . to illustrate our methodology , we apply the co-hits algorithm , with many different settings , to the application of query suggestion by mining the aol query log data . experimental results demonstrate that coregu-0 .5 ( i.e. , a model of the regularization framework ) achieves the best performance with consistent and promising improvements .

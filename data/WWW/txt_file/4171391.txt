beyond xml and rdf : the versatile web query language xcerpt applications and services that access web data are becoming increasingly more useful and wide-spread . current main-stream web query languages such as xquery , xslt , or sparql , however , focus only on one of the different data formats available on the web . in contrast , xcerpt is a emphversatile semi-structured query language , i.e. , a query language able to access all kinds of web data such as xml and rdf in the same language reusing common concepts and language constructs . to integrate heterogeneous data and as a foundation for semantic web reasoning , xcerpt also provides rules . xcerpt has a visual companion language , visxcerpt , that is conceived as a mere rendering of the ( textual ) query language xcerpt using a slightly extended css . both languages are demonstrated along a realistic use case integrating xml and rdf data highlighting interesting and unique features . novel language constructs and optimization techniques are currently under investigation in the xcerpt project ( cf. @ urlhttp : \/ \/ xcerpt.org \/ ) .

homepage live : automatic block tracing for web personalization the emergence of personalized homepage services , e.g. personalized google homepage and microsoft windows live , has enabled web users to select web contents of interest and to aggregate them in a single web page . the web contents are often predefined content blocks provided by the service providers . however , it involves intensive manual efforts to define the content blocks and maintain the information in it . in this paper , we propose a novel personalized homepage system , called . homepage live. , to allow end users to use drag-and-drop actions to collect their favorite web content blocks from existing web pages and organize them in a single page . moreover , homepage live automatically traces the changes of blocks with the evolvement of the container pages by measuring the tree edit distance of the selected blocks . by exploiting the immutable elements of web pages , the tracing algorithm performance is significantly improved . the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm .

a probabilistic framework for semi-supervised clustering unsupervised clustering can be significantly improved using supervision in the form of pairwise constraints , i.e. , pairs of instances labeled as belonging to same or different clusters . in recent years , a number of algorithms have been proposed for enhancing clustering quality by employing such supervision . such methods use the constraints to either modify the objective function , or to learn the distance measure . we propose a probabilistic model for semi-supervised clustering based on hidden markov random fields ( hmrfs ) that provides a principled framework for incorporating supervision into prototype-based clustering . the model generalizes a previous approach that combines constraints and euclidean distance learning , and allows the use of a broad range of clustering distortion measures , including bregman divergences ( e.g. , euclidean distance and i-divergence ) and directional similarity measures ( e.g. , cosine similarity ) . we present an algorithm that performs partitional semi-supervised clustering of data by minimizing an objective function derived from the posterior energy of the hmrf model . experimental results on several text data sets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework .

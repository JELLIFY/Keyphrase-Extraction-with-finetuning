a trust management framework for service-oriented environments many reputation management systems have been developed under the assumption that each entity in the system will use a variant of the same scoring function . much of the previous work in reputation management has focused on providing robustness and improving performance for a given reputation scheme . in this paper , we present a reputation-based trust management framework that supports the synthesis of trust-related feedback from many different entities while also providing each entity with the flexibility to apply different scoring functions over the same feedback data for customized trust evaluations . we also propose a novel scheme to cache trust values based on recent client activity . to evaluate our approach , we implemented our trust management service and tested it on a realistic application scenario in both lan and wan distributed environments . our results indicate that our trust management service can effectively support multiple scoring functions with low overhead and high availability .

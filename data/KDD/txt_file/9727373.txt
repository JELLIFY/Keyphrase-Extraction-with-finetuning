probabilistic frequent itemset mining in uncertain databases probabilistic frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databases semantically and computationally differs from traditional techniques applied to standard `` certain '' transaction databases . the consideration of existential uncertainty of item ( sets ) , indicating the probability that an item ( set ) occurs in a transaction , makes traditional techniques inapplicable . in this paper , we introduce new probabilistic formulations of frequent itemsets based on possible world semantics . in this probabilistic context , an itemset x is called frequent if the probability that x occurs in at least minsup transactions is above a given threshold Ï„ . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first approach addressing this problem under possible worlds semantics . in consideration of the probabilistic formulations , we present a framework which is able to solve the probabilistic frequent itemset mining ( pfim ) problem efficiently . an extensive experimental evaluation investigates the impact of our proposed techniques and shows that our approach is orders of magnitude faster than straight-forward approaches .

atmen : a triggered network measurement infrastructure web performance measurements and availability tests have been carried out using a variety of infrastructures over the last several years . disruptions in the internet can lead to web sites being unavailable or increase user-perceived latency . the unavailability could be due to dns , failures in segments of the physical network cutting off thousands of users , or attacks . prompt reactions to network-wide events can be facilitated by local or remote measurement and monitoring . better yet , a distributed set of intercommunicating measurement and monitoring entities that react to events dynamically could go a long way to handle disruptions . we have designed and built atmen , a triggered measurement infrastructure to communicate and coordinate across various administrative entities . atmen nodes can trigger new measurements , query ongoing passive measurements or historical measurements stored on remote nodes , and coordinate the responses to make local decisions . atmen reduces wasted measurements by judiciously reusing measurements along three axes : spatial , temporal , and application . we describe the use of atmen for key web applications such as performance based ranking of popular web sites and availability of dns servers on which most web transactions are dependent . the evaluation of atmen is done using multiple network monitoring entities called gigascopes installed across the usa , measurement data of a popular network application involving millions of users distributed across the internet , and scores of clients to aid in gathering measurement information upon demand . our results show that such a system can be built in a scalable fashion .

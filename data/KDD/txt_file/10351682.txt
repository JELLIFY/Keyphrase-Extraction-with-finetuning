angle-based outlier detection in high-dimensional data detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data mining task aiming at finding different mechanisms responsible for different groups of objects in a data set . all existing approaches , however , are based on an assessment of distances ( sometimes indirectly by assuming certain distributions ) in the full-dimensional euclidean data space . in high-dimensional data , these approaches are bound to deteriorate due to the notorious `` curse of dimensionality '' . in this paper , we propose a novel approach named abod ( angle-based outlier detection ) and some variants assessing the variance in the angles between the difference vectors of a point to the other points . this way , the effects of the `` curse of dimensionality '' are alleviated compared to purely distance-based approaches . a main advantage of our new approach is that our method does not rely on any parameter selection influencing the quality of the achieved ranking . in a thorough experimental evaluation , we compare abod to the well-established distance-based method lof for various artificial and a real world data set and show abod to perform especially well on high-dimensional data .

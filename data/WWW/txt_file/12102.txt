meteor-s web service annotation framework the world wide web is emerging not only as an infrastructure for data , but also for a broader variety of resources that are increasingly being made available as web services . relevant current standards like uddi , wsdl , and soap are in their fledgling years and form the basis of making web services a workable and broadly adopted technology . however , realizing the fuller scope of the promise of web services and associated service oriented architecture will requite further technological advances in the areas of service interoperation , service discovery , service composition , and process orchestration . semantics , especially as supported by the use of ontologies , and related semantic web technologies , are likely to provide better qualitative and scalable solutions to these requirements . just as semantic annotation of data in the semantic web is the first critical step to better search , integration and analytics over heterogeneous data , semantic annotation of web services is an equally critical first step to achieving the above promise . our approach is to work with existing web services technologies and combine them with ideas from the semantic web to create a better framework for web service discovery and composition . in this paper we present mwsaf ( meteor-s web service annotation framework ) , a framework for semi-automatically marking up web service descriptions with ontologies . we have developed algorithms to match and annotate wsdl files with relevant ontologies . we use domain ontologies to categorize web services into domains . an empirical study of our approach is presented to help evaluate its performance .

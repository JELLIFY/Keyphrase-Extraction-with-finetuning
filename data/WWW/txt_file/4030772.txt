web projections : learning from contextual subgraphs of the web graphical relationships among web pages have been exploited inmethods for ranking search results . to date , specific graphicalproperties have been used in these analyses . we introduce a webprojection methodology that generalizes prior efforts of graphicalrelationships of the web in several ways . with the approach , wecreate subgraphs by projecting sets of pages and domains onto thelarger web graph , and then use machine learning to constructpredictive models that consider graphical properties as evidence . wedescribe the method and then present experiments that illustrate theconstruction of predictive models of search result quality and userquery reformulation .

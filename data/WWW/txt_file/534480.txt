improved annotation of the blogosphere via autotagging and hierarchical clustering tags have recently become popular as a means of annotating and organizing web pages and blog entries . advocates of tagging argue that the use of tags produces a ` folksonomy ' , a system in which the meaning of a tag is determined by its use among the community as a whole . we analyze the effectiveness of tags for classifying blog entries by gathering the top 350 tags from technorati and measuring the similarity of all articles that share a tag . we find that tags are useful for grouping articles into broad categories , but less effective in indicating the particular content of an article . we then show that automatically extracting words deemed to be highly relevant can produce a more focused categorization of articles . we also show that clustering algorithms can be used to reconstruct a topical hierarchy among tags , and suggest that these approaches may be used to address some of the weaknesses in current tagging systems .

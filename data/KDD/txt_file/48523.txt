exploiting unlabeled data in ensemble methods an adaptive semi-supervised ensemble method , assemble , is proposed that constructs classification ensembles based on both labeled and unlabeled data . assemble alternates between assigning `` pseudo-classes '' to the unlabeled data using the existing ensemble and constructing the next base classifier using both the labeled and pseudolabeled data . mathematically , this intuitive algorithm corresponds to maximizing the classification margin in hypothesis space as measured on both the labeled and unlabeled of data . unlike alternative approaches , assemble does not require a semi-supervised learning method for the base classifier . assemble can be used in conjunction with any cost-sensitive classification algorithm for both two-class and multi-class problems . assemble using decision trees won the nips 2001 unlabeled data competition . in addition , strong results on several benchmark datasets using both decision trees and neural networks support the proposed method .

tcoz approach to semantic web services design complex semantic web ( sw ) services may have intricate data state , autonomous process behavior and concurrent interactions . the design of such sw service systems requires precise and powerful modelling techniques to capture not only the ontology domain properties but also the services ' process behavior and functionalities . in this paper we apply an integrated formal modeling language , timed communicating object z ( tcoz ) , to design sw services . furthermore , the paper presents the development of the systematic translation rules and tools which can automatically extract the sw ontology and services semantic markup from the formal tcoz design model .

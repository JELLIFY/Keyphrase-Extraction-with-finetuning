efficient similarity joins for near duplicate detection with the increasing amount of data and the need to integrate data from multiple data sources , a challenging issue is to find near duplicate records efficiently . in this paper , we focus on efficient algorithms to find pairs of records such that their similarities are above a given threshold . several existing algorithms rely on the prefix filtering principle to avoid computing similarity values for all possible pairs of records . we propose new filtering techniques by exploiting the ordering information ; they are integrated into the existing methods and drastically reduce the candidate sizes and hence improve the efficiency . experimental results show that our proposed algorithms can achieve up to 2.6 x - 5x speed-up over previous algorithms on several real datasets and provide alternative solutions to the near duplicate web page detection problem .

answering approximate queries over autonomous web databases to deal with the problem of empty or too little answers returned from a web database in response to a user query , this paper proposes a novel approach to provide relevant and ranked query results . based on the user original query , we speculate how much the user cares about each specified attribute and assign a corresponding weight to it . this original query is then rewritten as an approximate query by relaxing the query criteria range . the relaxation order of all specified attributes and the relaxed degree on each specified attribute are varied with the attribute weights . for the approximate query results , we generate users ' contextual preferences from database workload and use them to create a priori orders of tuples in an off-line preprocessing step . only a few representative orders are saved , each corresponding to a set of contexts . then , these orders and associated contexts are used at query time to expeditiously provide ranked answers . results of a preliminary user study demonstrate that our query relaxation and results ranking methods can capture the user 's preferences effectively . the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is also demonstrated by experimental result .

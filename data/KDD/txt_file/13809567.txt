an integrated machine learning approach to stroke prediction stroke is the third leading cause of death and the principal cause of serious long-term disability in the united states . accurate prediction of stroke is highly valuable for early intervention and treatment . in this study , we compare the cox proportional hazards model with a machine learning approach for stroke prediction on the cardiovascular health study ( chs ) dataset . specifically , we consider the common problems of data imputation , feature selection , and prediction in medical datasets . we propose a novel automatic feature selection algorithm that selects robust features based on our proposed heuristic : conservative mean . combined with support vector machines ( svms ) , our proposed feature selection algorithm achieves a greater area under the roc curve ( auc ) as compared to the cox proportional hazards model and l1 regularized cox feature selection algorithm . furthermore , we present a margin-based censored regression algorithm that combines the concept of margin-based classifiers with censored regression to achieve a better concordance index than the cox model . overall , our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both metrics of auc and concordance index . in addition , our work has also identified potential risk factors that have not been discovered by traditional approaches . our method can be applied to clinical prediction of other diseases , where missing data are common and risk factors are not well understood .

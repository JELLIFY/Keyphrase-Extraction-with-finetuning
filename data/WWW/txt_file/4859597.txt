rapid prototyping of web applications combining domain specific languages and model driven design there have been several authoring methods proposed in the literature that are model based , essentially following the model driven design philosophy . while useful , such methods need an effective way to allow the application designer to somehow synthesize the actual running application from the specification . in this paper , we describe hyperde , an environment that combines model driven design and domain specific languages to enable rapid prototyping of web applications .

a client-server architecture for state-dependent dynamic visualizations on the web as sophisticated enterprise applications move to the web , some advanced user experiences become difficult to migrate due to prohibitively high computation , memory , and bandwidth requirements . state-dependent visualizations of large-scale data sets are particularly difficult since a change in the client 's context necessitates a change in the displayed results . this paper describes a web architecture where clients are served a session-specific image of the data , with this image divided into tiles dynamically generated by the server . this set of tiles is supplemented with a corpus of metadata describing the immediate vicinity of interest ; additional metadata is delivered as needed in a progressive fashion in support and anticipation of the user 's actions . we discuss how the design of this architecture was motivated by the goal of delivering a highly responsive user experience . as an example of a complete application built upon this architecture , we present orgmaps , an interactive system for navigating hierarchical data , enabling fluid , low-latency navigation of trees of hundreds of thousands of nodes on standard web browsers using only html and javascript .

extracting relevant named entities for automated expense reimbursement expense reimbursement is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process across organizations . in this paper , we present a prototype expense reimbursement system that dramatically reduces the elapsed time and costs involved , by eliminating paper from the process life cycle . our complete solution involves ( 1 ) an electronic submission infrastructure that provides multi - channel image capture , secure transport and centralized storage of paper documents ; ( 2 ) an unconstrained data mining approach to extracting relevant named entities from un-structured document images ; ( 3 ) automation of auditing procedures that enables automatic expense validation with minimum human interaction . extracting relevant named entities robustly from document images with unconstrained layouts and diverse formatting is a fundamental technical challenge to image-based data mining , question answering , and other information retrieval tasks . in many applications that require such capability , applying traditional language modeling techniques to the stream of ocr text does not give satisfactory result due to the absence of linguistic context . we present an approach for extracting relevant named entities from document images by combining rich page layout features in the image space with language content in the ocr text using a discriminative conditional random field ( crf ) framework . we integrate this named entity extraction engine into our expense reimbursement solution and evaluate the system performance on large collections of real-world receipt images provided by ibm world wide reimbursement center .

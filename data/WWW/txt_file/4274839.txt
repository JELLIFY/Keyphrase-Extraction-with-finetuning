browsing on small screens : recasting web-page segmentation into an efficient machine learning framework fitting enough information from webpages to make browsing on small screens compelling is a challenging task . one approach is to present the user with a thumbnail image of the full web page and allow the user to simply press a single key to zoom into a region ( which may then be transcoded into wml\/xhtml , summarized , etc ) . however , if regions for zooming are presented naively , this yields a frustrating experience because of the number of coherent regions , sentences , images , and words that may be inadvertently separated . here , we cast the web page segmentation problem into a machine learning framework , where we re-examine this task through the lens of entropy reduction and decision tree learning . this yields an efficient and effective page segmentation algorithm . we demonstrate how simple techniques from computer vision can be used to fine-tune the results . the resulting segmentation keeps coherent regions together when tested on a broad set of complex webpages .

rule interestingness analysis using olap operations the problem of interestingness of discovered rules has been investigated by many researchers . the issue is that data mining algorithms often generate too many rules , which make it very hard for the user to find the interesting ones . over the years many techniques have been proposed . however , few have made it to real-life applications . since august 2004 , we have been working on a major application for motorola . the objective is to find causes of cellular phone call failures from a large amount of usage log data . class association rules have been shown to be suitable for this type of diagnostic data mining application . we were also able to put several existing interestingness methods to the test , which revealed some major shortcomings . one of the main problems is that most existing methods treat rules individually . however , we discovered that users seldom regard a single rule to be interesting by itself . a rule is only interesting in the context of some other rules . furthermore , in many cases , each individual rule may not be interesting , but a group of them together can represent an important piece of knowledge . this led us to discover a deficiency of the current rule mining paradigm . using non-zero minimum support and non-zero minimum confidence eliminates a large amount of context information , which makes rule analysis difficult . this paper proposes a novel approach to deal with all of these issues , which casts rule analysis as olap operations and general impression mining . this approach enables the user to explore the knowledge space to find useful knowledge easily and systematically . it also provides a natural framework for visualization . as an evidence of its effectiveness , our system , called opportunity map , based on these ideas has been deployed , and it is in daily use in motorola for finding actionable knowledge from its engineering and other types of data sets .

towards efficient dominant relationship exploration of the product items on the web in recent years , there has been a prevalence of search engines being employed to find useful information in the web as they efficiently explore hyperlinks between web pages which define a natural graph structure that yields a good ranking . unfortunately , current search engines can not effectively rank those relational data , which exists on dynamic websites supported by online databases . in this study , to rank such structured data ( i.e. , find the `` best '' items ) , we propose an integrated online system consisting of compressed data structure to encode the dominant relationship of the relational data . efficient querying strategies and updating scheme are devised to facilitate the ranking process . extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods . as such , we believe the work in this poster can be complementary to traditional search engines .

testbed for information extraction from deep web search results generated by searchable databases are served dynamically and far larger than the static documents on the web . these results pages have been referred to as the deep web . we need to extract the target data in results pages to integrate them on different searchable databases . we propose a test bed for information extraction from search results . we chose 100 databases randomly from 114,540 pages with search forms . therefore , these databases have a good variety . we selected 51 databases which include urls in a results pageand manually identify target information to be extracted . we also suggest evaluation measures for comparing extraction methods and methods for extending the target data .

named entity mining from click-through data using weakly supervised latent dirichlet allocation this paper addresses named entity mining ( nem ) , in which we mine knowledge about named entities such as movies , games , and books from a huge amount of data . nem is potentially useful in many applications including web search , online advertisement , and recommender system . there are three challenges for the task : finding suitable data source , coping with the ambiguities of named entity classes , and incorporating necessary human supervision into the mining process . this paper proposes conducting nem by using click-through data collected at a web search engine , employing a topic model that generates the click-through data , and learning the topic model by weak supervision from humans . specifically , it characterizes each named entity by its associated queries and urls in the click-through data . it uses the topic model to resolve ambiguities of named entity classes by representing the classes as topics . it employs a method , referred to as weakly supervised latent dirichlet allocation ( ws-lda ) , to accurately learn the topic model with partially labeled named entities . experiments on a large scale click-through data containing over 1.5 billion query-url pairs show that the proposed approach can conduct very accurate nem and significantly outperforms the baseline .

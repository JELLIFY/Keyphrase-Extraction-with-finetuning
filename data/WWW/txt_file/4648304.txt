topic-oriented query expansion for web search the contribution of this paper includes three folders : ( 1 ) to introduce a topic-oriented query expansion model based on the information bottleneck theory that classify terms into distinct topical clusters in order to find out candidate terms for the query expansion . ( 2 ) to define a term-term similarity matrix that is available to improve the term ambiguous problem . ( 3 ) to propose two measures , intracluster and intercluster similarities , that are based on proximity between the topics represented by two clusters in order to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness . results of several evaluation experiments in web search exhibit the average intracluster similarity was improved for the gain of 79.1 % while the average intercluster similarity was decreased for the loss of 36.0 % .

ws-replication : a framework for highly available web services due to the rapid acceptance of web services and its fast spreading , a number of mission-critical systems will be deployed as web services in next years . the availability of those systems must be guaranteed in case of failures and network disconnections . an example of web services for which availability will be a crucial issue are those belonging to coordination web service infrastructure , such as web services for transactional coordination ( e.g. , ws-caf and ws-transaction ) . these services should remain available despite site and connectivity failures to enable business interactions on a 24x7 basis . some of the common techniques for attaining availability consist in the use of a clustering approach . however , in an internet setting a domain can get partitioned from the network due to a link overload or some other connectivity problems . the unavailability of a coordination service impacts the availability of all the partners in the business process . that is , coordination services are an example of critical components that need higher provisions for availability . in this paper , we address this problem by providing an infrastructure , ws-replication , for wan replication of web services . the infrastructure is based on a group communication web service , ws-multicast , that respects the web service autonomy . the transport of ws-multicast is based on soap and relies exclusively on web service technology for interaction across organizations . we have replicated ws-caf using our ws-replication framework and evaluated its performance .

the powerrank web link analysis algorithm the web graph follows the power law distribution and has a hierarchy structure . but neither the pagerank algorithm nor any of its improvements leverage these attributes . in this paper , we propose a novel link analysis algorithm `` the powerrank algorithm '' , which makes use of the power law distribution attribute and the hierarchy structure of the web graph . the algorithm consists two parts . in the first part , special treatment is applied to the web pages with low `` importance '' score . in the second part , the global `` importance '' score for each web page is obtained by combining those scores together . our experimental results show that : 1 ) the powerrank algorithm computes 10 % -30 % faster than pagerank algorithm . 2 ) top web pages in powerrank algorithm remain similar to that of the pagerank algorithm .

b-bit minwise hashing this paper establishes the theoretical framework of b-bit minwise hashing . the original minwise hashing method has become a standard technique for estimating set similarity ( e.g. , resemblance ) with applications in information retrieval , data management , computational advertising , etc. . by only storing b bits of each hashed value ( e.g. , b = 1 or 2 ) , we gain substantial advantages in terms of storage space . we prove the basic theoretical results and provide an unbiased estimator of the resemblance for any b. we demonstrate that , even in the least favorable scenario , using b = 1 may reduce the storage space at least by a factor of 21.3 ( or 10.7 ) compared to b = 64 ( or b = 32 ) , if one is interested in resemblance ) 0.5 .

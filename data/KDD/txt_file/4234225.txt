density-based clustering of uncertain data in many different application areas , e.g. sensor databases , location based services or face recognition systems , distances between odjects have to be computed based on vague and uncertain data . commonly , the distances between these uncertain object descriptions are expressed by one numerical distance value . based on such single-valued distance functions standard data mining algorithms can work without any changes . in this paper , we propose to express the similarity between two fuzzy objects by distance probability functions . these fuzzy distance functions assign a probability value to each possible distance value . by integrating these fuzzy distance functions directly into data mining algorithms , the full information provided by these functions is exploited . in order to demonstrate the benefits of this general approach , we enhance the density-based clustering algorithm dbscan so that it can work directly on these fuzzy distance functions . in a detailed experimental evaluation based on artificial and real-world data sets , we show the characteristics and benefits of our new approach .

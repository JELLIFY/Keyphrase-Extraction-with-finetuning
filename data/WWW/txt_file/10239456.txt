query-driven indexing for peer-to-peer text retrieval we describe a query-driven indexing framework for scalable text retrieval over structured p2p networks . to cope with the bandwidth consumption problem that has been identified as the major obstacle for full-text retrieval in p2p networks , we truncate posting lists associated with indexing features to a constant size storing only top-k ranked document references . to compensate for the loss of information caused by the truncation , we extend the set of indexing features with carefully chosen term sets . indexing term sets are selected based on the query statistics extracted from query logs , thus we index only such combinations that are a ) frequently present in user queries and b ) non-redundant w.r.t the rest of the index . the distributed index is compact and efficient as it constantly evolves adapting to the current query popularity distribution . moreover , it is possible to control the tradeoff between the storage\/bandwidth requirements and the quality of query answering by tuning the indexing parameters . our theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that we can indeed achieve scalable p2p text retrieval for very large document collections and deliver good retrieval performance .

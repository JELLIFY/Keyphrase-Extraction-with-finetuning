on the temporal dimension of search web search is probably the single most important application on the internet . the most famous search techniques are perhaps the pagerank and hits algorithms . these algorithms are motivated by the observation that a hyperlink from a page to another is an implicit conveyance of authority to the target page . they exploit this social phenomenon to identify quality pages , e.g. , `` authority '' pages and `` hub '' pages . in this paper we argue that these algorithms miss an important dimension of the web , the temporal dimension . the web is not a static environment . it changes constantly . quality pages in the past may not be quality pages now or in the future . these techniques favor older pages because these pages have many in-links accumulated over time . new pages , which may be of high quality , have few or no in-links and are left behind . bringing new and quality pages to users is important because most users want the latest information . research publication search has exactly the same problem . this paper studies the temporal dimension of search in the context of research publication search . we propose a number of methods deal with the problem . our experimental results show that these methods are highly effective .

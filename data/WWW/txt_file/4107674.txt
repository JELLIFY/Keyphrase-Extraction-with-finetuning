information flow modeling based on diffusion rate for prediction and ranking information flows in a network where individuals influence each other . the diffusion rate captures how efficiently the information can diffuse among the users in the network . we propose an information flow model that leverages diffusion rates for : ( 1 ) prediction . identify where information should flow to , and ( 2 ) ranking . identify who will most quickly receive the information . for prediction , we measure how likely information will propagate from a specific sender to a specific receiver during a certain time period . accordingly a rate-based recommendation algorithm is proposed that predicts who will most likely receive the information during a limited time period . for ranking , we estimate the expected time for information diffusion to reach a specific user in a network . subsequently , a diffusionrank algorithm is proposed that ranks users based on how quickly information will flow to them . experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms to both improve the recommendation performance and rank users by the efficiency of information flow .

clustering for opportunistic communication we describe ongoing work on i2i , a system aimed at fostering opportunistic communication among users viewing or manipulating content on the web and in productivity applications . unlike previous work in which the urls of web resources are used to group users visiting the same resource , we present a more general framework for clustering work contexts to group users together that accounts for dynamic content and distributional properties of web accesses which can limit the utility url based systems . in addition , we describe a method for scaffolding asynchronous communication in the context of an ongoing task that takes into account the ephemeral nature of the location of content on the web . the techniques we describe also nicely cover local files in progress , in addition to publicly available web content . we present the results of several evaluations that indicate systems that use the techniques we employ may be more useful than systems that are strictly url based .

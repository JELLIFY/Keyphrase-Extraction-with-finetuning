an adaptive , fast , and safe xml parser based on byte sequences memorization xml ( extensible markup language ) processing can incur significant runtime overhead in xml-based infrastructural middleware such as web service application servers . this paper proposes a novel mechanism for efficiently processing similar xml documents . given a new xml document as a byte sequence , the xml parser proposed in this paper normally avoids syntactic analysis but simply matches the document with previously processed ones , reusing those results . our parser is adaptive since it partially parses and then remembers xml document fragments that it has not met before . moreover , it processes safely since its partial parsing correctly checks the well-formedness of documents . our implementation of the proposed parser complies with the jsr 63 standard of the java api for xml processing ( jaxp ) 1.1 specification . we evaluated deltarser performance with messages using google web services . comparing to piccolo ( and apache xerces ) , it effectively parses 35 % ( 106 % ) faster in a server-side use-case scenario , and 73 % ( 126 % ) faster in a client-side use-case scenario .

web page classification with heterogeneous data fusion web pages are more than text and they contain much contextual and structural information , e.g. , the title , the meta data , the anchor text , etc. , each of which can be seen as a data source or are presentation . due to the different dimensionality and different representing forms of these heterogeneous data sources , simply putting them together would not greatly enhance the classification performance . we observe that via a kernel function , different dimensions and types of data sources can be represented into acommon format of kernel matrix , which can be seen as a generalized similarity measure between a pair of web pages . in this sense , a kernel learning approach is employed to fuse these heterogeneous data sources . the experimental results on a collection of the odp database validate the advantages of the proposed method over traditional methods based on any single data source and the uniformly weighted combination of them .

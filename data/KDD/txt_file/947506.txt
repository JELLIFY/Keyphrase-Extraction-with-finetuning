integrating feature and instance selection for text classification instance selection and feature selection are two orthogonal methods for reducing the amount and complexity of data . feature selection aims at the reduction of redundant features in a dataset whereas instance selection aims at the reduction of the number of instances . so far , these two methods have mostly been considered in isolation . in this paper , we present a new algorithm , which we call fis ( feature and instance selection ) that targets both problems simultaneously in the context of text classificationour experiments on the reuters and 20-newsgroups datasets show that fis considerably reduces both the number of features and the number of instances . the accuracy of a range of classifiers including na√Øve bayes , tan and lb considerably improves when using the fis preprocessed datasets , matching and exceeding that of support vector machines , which is currently considered to be one of the best text classification methods . in all cases the results are much better compared to mutual information based feature selection . the training and classification speed of all classifiers is also greatly improved .

expertise networks in online communities : structure and algorithms web-based communities have become important places for people to seek and share expertise . we find that networks in these communities typically differ in their topology from other online networks such as the world wide web . systems targeted to augment web-based communities by automatically identifying users with expertise , for example , need to adapt to the underlying interaction dynamics . in this study , we analyze the java forum , a large online help-seeking community , using social network analysis methods . we test a set of network-based ranking algorithms , including pagerank and hits , on this large size social network in order to identify users with high expertise . we then use simulations to identify a small number of simple simulation rules governing the question-answer dynamic in the network . these simple rules not only replicate the structural characteristics and algorithm performance on the empirically observed java forum , but also allow us to evaluate how other algorithms may perform in communities with different characteristics . we believe this approach will be fruitful for practical algorithm design and implementation for online expertise-sharing communities .

lock-free consistency control for web 2.0 applications online collaboration and sharing is the central theme of many web-based services that create the so-called web 2.0 phenomena . using the internet as a computing platform , many web 2.0 applications set up mirror sites to provide large-scale availability and to achieve load balance . however , in the age of web 2.0 , where every user is also a writer and publisher , the deployment of mirror sites makes consistency maintenance a web scale problem . traditional concurrency control methods ( e.g. two phase lock , serialization , etc. ) are not up to the task for several reasons . first , large network latency between mirror sites will make two phase locking a throughput bottleneck . second , locking will block a large portion of concurrent operations , which makes it impossible to provide large-scale availability . on the other hand , most web 2.0 operations do not need strict serializability - it is not the intention of a user who is correcting a typo in a shared document to block another who is adding a comment , as long as consistency can still be achieved . thus , in order to enable maximal online collaboration and sharing , we need a lock-free mechanism that can maintain consistency among mirror sites on the web . in this paper , we propose a flexible and efficient method to achieve consistency maintenance in the web 2.0 world . our experiments show its good performance improvement compared with existing methods based on distributed lock .

trurank : taking pagerank to the limit pagerank is defined as the stationary state of a markov chain depending on a damping factor α that spreads uniformly part of the rank . the choice of α is eminently empirical , and in most cases the original suggestion α = 0.85 by brin and page is still used . it is common belief that values of α closer to 1 give a `` truer to the web '' pagerank , but a small α accelerates convergence . recently , however , it has been shown that when α = 1 all pages in the core component are very likely to have rank 0 ( 1 ) . this behavior makes it difficult to understand pagerank when α ≈ 1 , as it converges to a meaningless value for most pages . we propose a simple and natural modification to the standard preprocessing performed on the adjacency matrix of the graph , resulting in a ranking scheme we call trurank . trurank ranks the web with principles almost identical to pagerank , but it gives meaningful values also when α ☰ 1 .

learning nonstationary models of normal network traffic for detecting novel attacks traditional intrusion detection systems ( ids ) detect attacks by comparing current behavior to signatures of known attacks . one main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures . in this paper we propose a learning algorithm that constructs models of normal behavior from attack-free network traffic . behavior that deviates from the learned normal model signals possible novel attacks . our ids is unique in two respects . first , it is nonstationary , modeling probabilities based on the time since the last event rather than on average rate . this prevents alarm floods . second , the ids learns protocol vocabularies ( at the data link through application layers ) in order to detect unknown attacks that attempt to exploit implementation errors in poorly tested features of the target software . on the 1999 darpa ids evaluation data set ( 9 ) , we detect 70 of 180 attacks ( with 100 false alarms ) , about evenly divided between user behavioral anomalies ( ip addresses and ports , as modeled by most other systems ) and protocol anomalies . because our methods are unconventional there is a significant non-overlap of our ids with the original darpa participants , which implies that they could be combined to increase coverage .

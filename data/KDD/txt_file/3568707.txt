efficiently handling feature redundancy in high-dimensional data high-dimensional data poses a severe challenge for data mining . feature selection is a frequently used technique in pre-processing high-dimensional data for successful data mining . traditionally , feature selection is focused on removing irrelevant features . however , for high-dimensional data , removing redundant features is equally critical . in this paper , we provide a study of feature redundancy in high-dimensional data and propose a novel correlation-based approach to feature selection within the filter model . the extensive empirical study using real-world data shows that the proposed approach is efficient and effective in removing redundant and irrelevant features .

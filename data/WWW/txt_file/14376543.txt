information transfer in social media recent research has explored the increasingly important role of social media by examining the dynamics of individual and group behavior , characterizing patterns of information diffusion , and identifying influential individuals . in this paper we suggest a measure of causal relationships between nodes based on the information -- theoretic notion of transfer entropy , or information transfer . this theoretically grounded measure is based on dynamic information , captures fine -- grain notions of influence , and admits a natural , predictive interpretation . networks inferred by transfer entropy can differ significantly from static friendship networks because most friendship links are not useful for predicting future dynamics . we demonstrate through analysis of synthetic and real-world data that transfer entropy reveals meaningful hidden network structures . in addition to altering our notion of who is influential , transfer entropy allows us to differentiate between weak influence over large groups and strong influence over small groups .

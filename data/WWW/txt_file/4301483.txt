on anonymizing query logs via token-based hashing in this paper we study the privacy preservation properties of aspecific technique for query log anonymization : token-based hashing . in this approach , each query is tokenized , and then a secure hash function is applied to each token . we show that statistical techniques may be applied to partially compromise the anonymization . we then analyze the specific risks that arise from these partial compromises , focused on revelation of identity from unambiguous names , addresses , and so forth , and the revelation of facts associated with an identity that are deemed to be highly sensitive . our goal in this work is two fold : to show that token-based hashing is unsuitable for anonymization , and to present a concrete analysis of specific techniques that may be effective in breaching privacy , against which other anonymization schemes should be measured .

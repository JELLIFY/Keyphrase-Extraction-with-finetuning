recommending questions using the mdl-based tree cut model the paper is concerned with the problem of question recommendation . specifically , given a question as query , we are to retrieve and rank other questions according to their likelihood of being good recommendations of the queried question . a good recommendation provides alternative aspects around users ' interest . we tackle the problem of question recommendation in two steps : first represent questions as graphs of topic terms , and then rank recommendations on the basis of the graphs . we formalize both steps as the tree-cutting problems and then employ the mdl ( minimum description length ) for selecting the best cuts . experiments have been conducted with the real questions posted at yahoo ! answers . the questions are about two domains , ` travel ' and ` computers & internet ' . experimental results indicate that the use of the mdl-based tree cut model can significantly outperform the baseline methods of word-based vsm or phrase-based vsm . the results also show that the use of the mdl-based tree cut model is essential to our approach .

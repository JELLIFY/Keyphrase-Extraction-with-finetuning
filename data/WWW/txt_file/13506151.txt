deriving music theme annotations from user tags music theme annotations would be really beneficial for supporting retrieval , but are often neglected by users while annotating . thus , in order to support users in tagging and to fill the gaps in the tag space , in this paper we develop algorithms for recommending theme annotations . our methods exploit already existing user tags , the lyrics of music tracks , as well as combinations of both . we compare the results for our recommended theme annotations against genre and style recommendations - a much easier and already studied task . we evaluate the quality of our recommended tags against an expert ground truth data set . our results are promising and provide interesting insights into possible extensions for music tagging systems to support music search .

protecting electronic commerce from distributed denial-of-service attacks it is widely recognized that distributed denial-of-service ( ddos ) attacks can disrupt electronic commerce and cause large revenue losses . however , effective defenses continue to be mostly unavailable . we describe and evaluate vipnet , a novel value-added network service for protecting e-commerce and other transaction-based sites from ddos attacks . in vipnet , e-merchants pay internet service providers ( isps ) to carry the packets of the e-merchants ' best clients ( called vips ) in a privileged class of service ( cos ) , protected from congestion , whether malicious or not , in the regular cos. . vipnet rewards vips with not only better quality of service , but also greater availability . because vip rights are client - and server-specific , can not be forged , are usage-limited , and are only replenished after successful client transactions ( e.g. , purchases ) , it is impractical for attackers to mount and sustain ddos attacks against an e-merchant 's vips . vipnet can be deployed incrementally and does not require universal adoption . experiments demonstrate vipnet 's benefits .

forcehttps : protecting high-security web sites from network attacks as wireless networks proliferate , web browsers operate in an increasingly hostile network environment . the https protocol has the potential to protect web users from network attackers , but real-world deployments must cope with misconfigured servers , causing imperfect web sites and users to compromise browsing sessions inadvertently . forcehttps is a simple browser security mechanism that web sites or users can use to opt in to stricter error processing , improving the security of https by preventing network attacks that leverage the browser 's lax error processing . by augmenting the browser with a database of custom url rewrite rules , forcehttps allows sophisticated users to transparently retrofit security onto some insecure sites that support https . we provide a prototype implementation of forcehttps as a firefox browser extension .

efficient overlap and content reuse detection in blogs and online news articles the use of blogs to track and comment on real world ( political , news , entertainment ) events is growing . similarly , as more individuals start relying on the web as their primary information source and as more traditional media outlets try reaching consumers through alternative venues , the number of news sites on the web is also continuously increasing . content-reuse , whether in the form of extensive quotations or content borrowing across media outlets , is very common in blogs and news entries outlets tracking the same real-world event . knowledge about which web entries re-use content from which others can be an effective asset when organizing these entries for presentation . on the other hand , this knowledge is not cheap to acquire : considering the size of the related space web entries , it is essential that the techniques developed for identifying re-use are fast and scalable . furthermore , the dynamic nature of blog and news entries necessitates incremental processing for reuse detection . in this paper , we develop a novel qsign algorithm that efficiently and effectively analyze the blogosphere for quotation and reuse identification . experiment results show that with qsign processing time gains from 10x to 100x are possible while maintaining reuse detection rates of upto 90 % . furthermore , processing time gains can be pushed multiple orders of magnitude ( from 100x to 1000x ) for 70 % recall .

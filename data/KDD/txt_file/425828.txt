weighted association rule mining using weighted support and significance framework we address the issues of discovering significant binary relationships in transaction datasets in a weighted setting . traditional model of association rule mining is adapted to handle weighted association rule mining problems where each item is allowed to have a weight . the goal is to steer the mining focus to those significant relationships involving items with significant weights rather than being flooded in the combinatornal explosion of insignificant relationships . we identify the challenge of using weights in the iterative process of generating large itemsets . the problem of invalidation of the `` downward closure property '' in the weighted setting is solved by using an improved model of weighted support measurements and exploiting a `` weighted downward closure property '' . a new algorithm called warm ( weighted association rule mining ) is developed based on the improved model . the algorithm is both scalable and efficient in discovering significant relationships in weighted settings as illustrated by experiments performed on simulated datasets .

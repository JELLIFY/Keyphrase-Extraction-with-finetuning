where to adapt dynamic service compositions peer services depend on one another to accomplish their tasks , and their structures may evolve . a service composition may be designed to replace its member services whenever the quality of the composite service fails to meet certain quality-of-service ( qos ) requirements . finding services and service invocation endpoints having the greatest impact on the quality are important to guide subsequent service adaptations . this paper proposes a technique that samples the qos of composite services and continually analyzes them to identify artifacts for service adaptation . the preliminary results show that our technique has the potential to effectively find such artifacts in services .

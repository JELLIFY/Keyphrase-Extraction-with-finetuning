rated aspect summarization of short comments web 2.0 technologies have enabled more and more people to freely comment on different kinds of entities ( e.g. sellers , products , services ) . the large scale of information poses the need and challenge of automatic summarization . in many cases , each of the user-generated short comments comes with an overall rating . in this paper , we study the problem of generating a `` rated aspect summary '' of short comments , which is a decomposed view of the overall ratings for the major aspects so that a user could gain different perspectives towards the target entity . we formally define the problem and decompose the solution into three steps . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by using ebay sellers ' feedback comments . we also quantitatively evaluate each step of our methods and study how well human agree on such a summarization task . the proposed methods are quite general and can be used to generate rated aspect summary automatically given any collection of short comments each associated with an overall rating .

web scale nlp : a case study on url word breaking this paper uses the url word breaking task as an example to elaborate what we identify as crucial in designing statistical natural language processing ( nlp ) algorithms for web scale applications : ( 1 ) rudimentary multilingual capabilities to cope with the global nature of the web , ( 2 ) multi-style modeling to handle diverse language styles seen in the web contents , ( 3 ) fast adaptation to keep pace with the dynamic changes of the web , ( 4 ) minimal heuristic assumptions for generalizability and robustness , and ( 5 ) possibilities of efficient implementations and minimal manual efforts for processing massive amount of data at a reasonable cost . we first show that the state-of-the-art word breaking techniques can be unified and generalized under the bayesian minimum risk ( bmr ) framework that , using a web scale n-gram , can meet the first three requirements . we discuss how the existing techniques can be viewed as introducing additional assumptions to the basic bmr framework , and describe a generic yet efficient implementation called word synchronous beam search . testing the framework and its implementation on a series of large scale experiments reveals the following . first , the language style used to build the model plays a critical role in the word breaking task , and the most suitable for the url word breaking task appears to be that of the document title where the best performance is obtained . models created from other language styles , such as from document body , anchor text , and even queries , exhibit varying degrees of mismatch . although all styles benefit from increasing modeling power which , in our experiments , corresponds to the use of a higher order n-gram , the gain is most recognizable for the title model . the heuristics proposed by the prior arts do contribute to the word breaking performance for mismatched or less powerful models , but are less effective and , in many cases , lead to poorer performance than the matched model with minimal assumptions . for the matched model based on document titles , an accuracy rate of 97.18 % can already be achieved using simple trigram without any heuristics .

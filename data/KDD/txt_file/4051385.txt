mining rank-correlated sets of numerical attributes we study the mining of interesting patterns in the presence of numerical attributes . instead of the usual discretization methods , we propose the use of rank based measures to score the similarity of sets of numerical attributes . new support measures for numerical data are introduced , based on extensions of kendall 's tau , and spearman 's footrule and rho . we show how these support measures are related . furthermore , we introduce a novel type of pattern combining numerical and categorical attributes . we give efficient algorithms to find all frequent patterns for the proposed support measures , and evaluate their performance on real-life datasets .

web page rank prediction with markov models in this paper we propose a method for predicting the ranking position of a web page . assuming a set of successive past top-k rankings , we study the evolution of web pages in terms of ranking trend sequences used for markov models training , which are in turn used to predict future rankings . the predictions are highly accurate for all experimental setups and similarity measures .

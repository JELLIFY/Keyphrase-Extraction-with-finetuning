rest-based management of loosely coupled services applications increasingly make use of the distributed platform that the world wide web provides - be it as a software-as-a-service such as salesforce.com , an application infrastructure such as facebook.com , or a computing infrastructure such as a `` cloud '' . a common characteristic of applications of this kind is that they are deployed on infrastructure or make use of components that reside in different management domains . current service management approaches and systems , however , often rely on a centrally managed configuration management database ( cmdb ) , which is the basis for centrally orchestrated service management processes , in particular change management and incident management . the distribution of management responsibility of www based applications requires a decentralized approach to service management . this paper proposes an approach of decentralized service management based on distributed configuration management and service process co-ordination , making use restful access to configuration information and atom-based distribution of updates as a novel foundation for service management processes .

cluster-based concept invention for statistical relational learning we use clustering to derive new relations which augment database schema used in automatic generation of predictive features in statistical relational learning . entities derived from clusters increase the expressivity of feature spaces by creating new first-class concepts which contribute to the creation of new features . for example , in citeseer , papers can be clustered based on words or citations giving `` topics '' , and authors can be clustered based on documents they co-author giving `` communities '' . such cluster-derived concepts become part of more complex feature expressions . out of the large number of generated features , those which improve predictive accuracy are kept in the model , as decided by statistical feature selection criteria . we present results demonstrating improved accuracy on two tasks , venue prediction and link prediction , using citeseer data .

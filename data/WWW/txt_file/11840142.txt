ranking community answers via analogical reasoning due to the lexical gap between questions and answers , automatically detecting right answers becomes very challenging for community question-answering sites . in this paper , we propose an analogical reasoning-based method . it treats questions and answers as relational data and ranks an answer by measuring the analogy of its link to a query with the links embedded in previous relevant knowledge ; the answer that links in the most analogous way to the new question is assumed to be the best answer . we based our experiments on 29.8 million yahoo ! answer question-answer threads and showed the effectiveness of the approach .

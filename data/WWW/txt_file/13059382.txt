dynamics of bidding in a p2p lending service : effects of herding and predicting loan success online peer-to-peer ( p2p ) lending services are a new type of social platform that enables individuals borrow and lend money directly from one to another . in this paper , we study the dynamics of bidding behavior in a p2p loan auction website , prosper.com . we investigate the change of various attributes of loan requesting listings over time , such as the interest rate and the number of bids . we observe that there is herding behavior during bidding , and for most of the listings , the numbers of bids they receive reach spikes at very similar time points . we explain these phenomena by showing that there are economic and social factors that lenders take into account when deciding to bid on a listing . we also observe that the profits the lenders make are tied with their bidding preferences . finally , we build a model based on the temporal progression of the bidding , that reliably predicts the success of a loan request listing , as well as whether a loan will be paid back or not .

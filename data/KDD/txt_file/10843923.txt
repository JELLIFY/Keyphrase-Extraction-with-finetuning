exploring social tagging graph for web object classification this paper studies web object classification problem with the novel exploration of social tags . automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental preprocess for indexing , browsing , searching , and mining these objects . the explosive growth of heterogeneous web objects , especially non-textual objects such as products , pictures , and videos , has made the problem of web classification increasingly challenging . such objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable features with semantic information , interconnections between each other , as well as training examples with category labels . in this paper , we explore the social tagging data to bridge this gap . we cast web object classification problem as an optimization problem on a graph of objects and tags . we then propose an efficient algorithm which not only utilizes social tags as enriched semantic features for the objects , but also infers the categories of unlabeled objects from both homogeneous and heterogeneous labeled objects , through the implicit connection of social tags . experiment results show that the exploration of social tags effectively boosts web object classification . our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art of general classification methods .

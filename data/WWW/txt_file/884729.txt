sampling search-engine results we consider the problem of efficiently sampling web search engine query results . in turn , using a small random sample instead of the full set of results leads to efficient approximate algorithms for several applications , such as : determining the set of categories in a given taxonomy spanned by the search results ; finding the range of metadata values associated to the result set in order to enable `` multi-faceted search ; '' estimating the size of the result set ; data mining associations to the query terms . we present and analyze an efficient algorithm for obtaining uniform random samples applicable to any search engine based on posting lists and document-at-a-time evaluation . ( to our knowledge , all popular web search engines , e.g. google , inktomi , altavista , alltheweb , belong to this class . ) furthermore , our algorithm can be modified to follow the modern object-oriented approach whereby posting lists are viewed as streams equipped with a next method , and the next method for boolean and other complex queries is built from the next method for primitive terms . in our case we show how to construct a basic next ( p ) method that samples term posting lists with probability p , and show how to construct next ( p ) methods for boolean operators ( and , or , wand ) from primitive methods . finally , we test the efficiency and quality of our approach on both synthetic and real-world data .

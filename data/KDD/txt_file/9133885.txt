relational learning via collective matrix factorization relational learning is concerned with predicting unknown values of a relation , given a database of entities and observed relations among entities . an example of relational learning is movie rating prediction , where entities could include users , movies , genres , and actors . relations encode users ' ratings of movies , movies ' genres , and actors ' roles in movies . a common prediction technique given one pairwise relation , for example a #users x #movies ratings matrix , is low-rank matrix factorization . in domains with multiple relations , represented as multiple matrices , we may improve predictive accuracy by exploiting information from one relation while predicting another . to this end , we propose a collective matrix factorization model : we simultaneously factor several matrices , sharing parameters among factors when an entity participates in multiple relations . each relation can have a different value type and error distribution ; so , we allow nonlinear relationships between the parameters and outputs , using bregman divergences to measure error . we extend standard alternating projection algorithms to our model , and derive an efficient newton update for the projection . furthermore , we propose stochastic optimization methods to deal with large , sparse matrices . our model generalizes several existing matrix factorization methods , and therefore yields new large-scale optimization algorithms for these problems . our model can handle any pairwise relational schema and a wide variety of error models . we demonstrate its efficiency , as well as the benefit of sharing parameters among relations .

semantic wikipedia wikipedia is the world 's largest collaboratively edited source of encyclopaedic knowledge . but in spite of its utility , its contents are barely machine-interpretable . structural knowledge , e. , g. about how concepts are interrelated , can neither be formally stated nor automatically processed . also the wealth of numerical data is only available as plain text and thus can not be processed by its actual meaning . we provide an extension to be integrated in wikipedia , that allows the typing of links between articles and the specification of typed data inside the articles in an easy-to-use manner . enabling even casual users to participate in the creation of an open semantic knowledge base , wikipedia has the chance to become a resource of semantic statements , hitherto unknown regarding size , scope , openness , and internationalisation . these semantic enhancements bring to wikipedia benefits of today 's semantic technologies : more specific ways of searching and browsing . also , the rdf export , that gives direct access to the formalised knowledge , opens wikipedia up to a wide range of external applications , that will be able to use it as a background knowledge base . in this paper , we present the design , implementation , and possible uses of this extension .

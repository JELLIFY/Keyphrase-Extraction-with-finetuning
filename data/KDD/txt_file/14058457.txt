exploiting place features in link prediction on location-based social networks link prediction systems have been largely adopted to recommend new friends in online social networks using data about social interactions . with the soaring adoption of location-based social services it becomes possible to take advantage of an additional source of information : the places people visit . in this paper we study the problem of designing a link prediction system for online location-based social networks . we have gathered extensive data about one of these services , gowalla , with periodic snapshots to capture its temporal evolution . we study the link prediction space , finding that about 30 % of new links are added among `` place-friends '' , i.e. , among users who visit the same places . we show how this prediction space can be made 15 times smaller , while still 66 % of future connections can be discovered . thus , we define new prediction features based on the properties of the places visited by users which are able to discriminate potential future links among them . building on these findings , we describe a supervised learning framework which exploits these prediction features to predict new links among friends-of-friends and place-friends . our evaluation shows how the inclusion of information about places and related user activity offers high link prediction performance . these results open new directions for real-world link recommendation systems on location-based social networks .

on detecting differences between groups understanding the differences between contrasting groups is a fundamental task in data analysis . this realization has led to the development of a new special purpose data mining technique , contrast-set mining . we undertook a study with a retail collaborator to compare contrast-set mining with existing rule-discovery techniques . to our surprise we observed that straightforward application of an existing commercial rule-discovery system , magnum opus , could successfully perform the contrast-set-mining task . this led to the realization that contrast-set mining is a special case of the more general rule-discovery task . we present the results of our study together with a proof of this conclusion .

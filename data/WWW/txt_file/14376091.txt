discovering geographical topics in the twitter stream micro-blogging services have become indispensable communication tools for online users for disseminating breaking news , eyewitness accounts , individual expression , and protest groups . recently , twitter , along with other online social networking services such as foursquare , gowalla , facebook and yelp , have started supporting location services in their messages , either explicitly , by letting users choose their places , or implicitly , by enabling geo-tagging , which is to associate messages with latitudes and longitudes . this functionality allows researchers to address an exciting set of questions : 1 ) how is information created and shared across geographical locations , 2 ) how do spatial and linguistic characteristics of people vary across regions , and 3 ) how to model human mobility . although many attempts have been made for tackling these problems , previous methods are either complicated to be implemented or oversimplified that can not yield reasonable performance . it is a challenge task to discover topics and identify users ' interests from these geo-tagged messages due to the sheer amount of data and diversity of language variations used on these location sharing services . in this paper we focus on twitter and present an algorithm by modeling diversity in tweets based on topical diversity , geographical diversity , and an interest distribution of the user . furthermore , we take the markovian nature of a user 's location into account . our model exploits sparse factorial coding of the attributes , thus allowing us to deal with a large and diverse set of covariates efficiently . our approach is vital for applications such as user profiling , content recommendation and topic tracking . we show high accuracy in location estimation based on our model . moreover , the algorithm identifies interesting topics based on location and language .

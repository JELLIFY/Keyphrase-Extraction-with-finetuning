xquery in the browser since the invention of the web , the browser has become more and more powerful . by now , it is a programming and execution environment in itself . the predominant language to program applications in the browser today is javascript . with browsers becoming more powerful , javascript has been extended and new layers have been added ( e.g. , dom-support and xpath ) . today , javascript is very successful and applications and gui features implemented in the browser have become increasingly complex . the purpose of this paper is to improve the programmability of web browsers by enabling the execution of xquery programs in the browser . although it has the potential to ideally replace javascript , it is possible to run it in addition to javascript for more flexibility . furthermore , it allows instant code migration from the server to the client and vice-versa . this enables a significant simplification of the technology stack . the intuition is that programming the browser involves mostly xml ( i.e. , dom ) navigation and manipulation , and the xquery family of w3c standards were designed exactly for that purpose . the paper proposes extensions to xquery for web browsers and gives a number of examples that demonstrate the usefulness of xquery for the development of ajax-style applications . furthermore , the paper presents the design of an xquery plug-in for microsoft 's internet explorer . the paper also gives examples of applications which were developed with the help of this plug-in .

track globally , deliver locally : improving content delivery networks by tracking geographic social cascades providers such as youtube offer easy access to multimedia content to millions , generating high bandwidth and storage demand on the content delivery networks they rely upon . more and more , the diffusion of this content happens on online social networks such as facebook and twitter , where social cascades can be observed when users increasingly repost links they have received from others . in this paper we describe how geographic information extracted from social cascades can be exploited to improve caching of multimedia files in a content delivery network . we take advantage of the fact that social cascades can propagate in a geographically limited area to discern whether an item is spreading locally or globally . this informs cache replacement policies , which utilize this information to ensure that content relevant to a cascade is kept close to the users who may be interested in it . we validate our approach by using a novel dataset which combines social interaction data with geographic information : we track social cascades of youtube links over twitter and build a proof-of-concept geographic model of a realistic distributed content delivery network . our performance evaluation shows that we are able to improve cache hits with respect to cache policies without geographic and social information .

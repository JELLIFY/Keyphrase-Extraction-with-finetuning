behavioral profiles for advanced email features we examine the behavioral patterns of email usage in a large-scale enterprise over a three-month period . in particular , we focus on two main questions : ( q1 ) what do replies depend on ? and ( q2 ) what is the gain of augmenting contacts through the friends of friends from the email social graph ? for q1 , we identify and evaluate the significance of several factors that affect the reply probability and the email response time . we find that all factors of our considered set are significant , provide their relative ordering , and identify the recipient list size , and the intensity of email communication between the correspondents as the dominant factors . we highlight various novel threshold behaviors and provide support for existing hypotheses such as that of the least-effort reply . for q2 , we find that the number of new contacts extracted from the friends-of-friends relationships amounts to a large number , but which is still a limited portion of the total enterprise size . we believe that our results provide significant insights towards informed design of advanced email features , including those of social-networking type .

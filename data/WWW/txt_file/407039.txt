an ontology for internal and external business processes in this paper we introduce our multi metamodel process ontology ( m3po ) , which is based on various existing reference models and languages from the workflow and choreography domain . this ontology allows the extraction of arbitrary choreography interface descriptions from arbitrary internal workflow models . we also report on an initial validation : we translate an ibm websphere mq workflow model into the m3po ontology and then extract an abstract bpel model from the ontology .

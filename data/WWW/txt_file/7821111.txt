networked graphs : a declarative mechanism for sparql rules , sparql views and rdf data integration on the web easy reuse and integration of declaratively described information in a distributed setting is one of the main motivations for building the semantic web . despite of this claim , reuse and recombination of rdf data today is mostly done using data replication and procedural code . a simple declarative mechanism for reusing and combining rdf data would help users to generate content for the semantic web . having such a mechanism , the semantic web could better benefit from user generated content , as it is broadly present in the so called web 2.0 , but also from better linkage of existing content . we propose networked graphs , which allow users to define rdf graphs both , by extensionally listing content , but also by using views on other graphs . these views can be used to include parts of other graphs , to transform data before including it and to denote rules . the relationships between graphs are described declaratively using sparql queries and an extension of the sparql semantics . networked graphs are easily exchangeable between and interpretable on different computers . using existing protocols , networked graphss can be evaluated in a distributed setting .

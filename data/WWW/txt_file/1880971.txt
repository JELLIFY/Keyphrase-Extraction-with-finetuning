towards the self-annotating web the success of the semantic web depends on the availability of ontologies as well as on the proliferation of web pages annotated with metadata conforming to these ontologies . thus , a crucial question is where to acquire these metadata from . in this paper wepropose pankow ( pattern-based annotation through knowledge on theweb ) , a method which employs an unsupervised , pattern-based approach to categorize instances with regard to an ontology . the approach is evaluated against the manual annotations of two human subjects . the approach is implemented in ontomat , an annotation tool for the semantic web and shows very promising results .

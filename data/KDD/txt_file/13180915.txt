unsupervised feature selection for multi-cluster data in many data analysis tasks , one is often confronted with very high dimensional data . feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant feature subset of the original features which can facilitate clustering , classification and retrieval . in this paper , we consider the feature selection problem in unsupervised learning scenario , which is particularly difficult due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information . the feature selection problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem which is computationally expensive . traditional unsupervised feature selection methods address this issue by selecting the top ranked features based on certain scores computed independently for each feature . these approaches neglect the possible correlation between different features and thus can not produce an optimal feature subset . inspired from the recent developments on manifold learning and l1-regularized models for subset selection , we propose in this paper a new approach , called multi-cluster feature selection ( mcfs ) , for unsupervised feature selection . specifically , we select those features such that the multi-cluster structure of the data can be best preserved . the corresponding optimization problem can be efficiently solved since it only involves a sparse eigen-problem and a l1-regularized least squares problem . extensive experimental results over various real-life data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm .

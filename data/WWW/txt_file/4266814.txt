efficient search for peer-to-peer information retrieval using semantic small world this paper proposes a semantic overlay based on the small world phenomenon that facilitates efficient search for information retrieval in unstructured p2p systems . in the semantic overlay , each node maintains a number of short-range links which are semantically similar to each other , together with a small collection of long-range links that help increasing recall rate of information retrieval and reduce network traffic as well . experimental results show that our model can improve performance by 150 % compared to gnutella and by up to 60 % compared to the interest-based model - a similar shortcut-based search technique .

mining quantitative correlated patterns using an information-theoretic approach existing research on mining quantitative databases mainly focuses on mining associations . however , mining associations is too expensive to be practical in many cases . in this paper , we study mining correlations from quantitative databases and show that it is a more effective approach than mining associations . we propose a new notion of quantitative correlated patterns ( qcps ) , which is founded on two formal concepts , mutual information and all-confidence . we first devise a normalization on mutual information and apply it to qcp mining to capture the dependency between the attributes . we further adopt all-confidence as a quality measure to control , at a finer granularity , the dependency between the attributes with specific quantitative intervals . we also propose a supervised method to combine the consecutive intervals of the quantitative attributes based on mutual information , such that the interval combining is guided by the dependency between the attributes . we develop an algorithm , qcomine , to efficiently mine qcps by utilizing normalized mutual information and all-confidence to perform a two-level pruning . our experiments verify the efficiency of qcomine and the quality of the qcps .

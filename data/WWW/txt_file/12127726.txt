yago : a core of semantic knowledge we present yago , a light-weight and extensible ontology with high coverage and quality . yago builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts . this includes the is-a hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities ( such as hasoneprize ) . the facts have been automatically extracted from wikipedia and unified with wordnet , using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper . the resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond wordnet : in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons , organizations , products , etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude . our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95 % . yago is based on a logically clean model , which is decidable , extensible , and compatible with rdfs . finally , we show how yago can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques .

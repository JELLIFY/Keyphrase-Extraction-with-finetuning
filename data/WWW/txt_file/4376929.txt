clustering for probabilistic model estimation for cf based on the type of collaborative objects , a collaborative filtering ( cf ) system falls into one of two categories : item-based cf and user-based cf. clustering is the basic idea in both cases , where users or items are classified into user groups where users share similar preference or item groups where items have similar attributes or characteristics . observing the fact that in user-based cf each user community is characterized by a gaussian distribution on the ratings for each item and the fact that in item-based cf the ratings of each user in item community satisfy a gaussian distribution , we propose a method of probabilistic model estimation for cf , where objects ( user or items ) are classified into groups based on the content information and ratings at the same time and predictions are made considering the gaussian distribution of ratings . experiments on a real-world data set illustrate that our approach is favorable .

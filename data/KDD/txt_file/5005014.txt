empirical bayesian data mining for discovering patterns in post-marketing drug safety because of practical limits in characterizing the safety profiles of therapeutic products prior to marketing , manufacturers and regulatory agencies perform post-marketing surveillance based on the collection of adverse reaction reports ( `` pharmacovigilance '' ) . the resulting databases , while rich in real-world information , are notoriously difficult to analyze using traditional techniques . each report may involve multiple medicines , symptoms , and demographic factors , and there is no easily linked information on drug exposure in the reporting population . kdd techniques , such as association finding , are well-matched to the problem , but are difficult for medical staff to apply and interpret . to deploy kdd effectively for pharmacovigilance , lincoln technologies and glaxosmithkline collaborated to create a webbased safety data mining web environment . the analytical core is a high-performance implementation of the mgps ( multi-item gamma poisson shrinker ) algorithm described previously by dumouchel and pregibon , with several significant extensions and enhancements . the environment offers an interface for specifying data mining runs , a batch execution facility , tabular and graphical methods for exploring associations , and drilldown to case details . substantial work was involved in preparing the raw adverse event data for mining , including harmonization of drug names and removal of duplicate reports . the environment can be used to explore both drug-event and multi-way associations ( interactions , syndromes ) . it has been used to study age\/gender effects , to predict the safety profiles of proposed combination drugs , and to separate contributions of individual drugs to safety problems in polytherapy situations .

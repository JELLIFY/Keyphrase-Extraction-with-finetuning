scalable mining of large disk-based graph databases mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an interesting problem with broad applications . most of the previous studies focus on pruning unfruitful search subspaces effectively , but few of them address the mining on large , disk-based databases . as many graph databases in applications can not be held into main memory , scalable mining of large , disk-based graph databases remains a challenging problem . in this paper , we develop an effective index structure , adi ( for ( u ) ad ( \/ u ) jacency ( u ) i ( \/ u ) ndex ) , to support mining various graph patterns over large databases that can not be held into main memory . the index is simple and efficient to build . moreover , the new index structure can be easily adopted in various existing graph pattern mining algorithms . as an example , we adapt the well-known gspan algorithm by using the adi structure . the experimental results show that the new index structure enables the scalable graph pattern mining over large databases . in one set of the experiments , the new disk-based method can mine graph databases with one million graphs , while the original gspan algorithm can only handle databases of up to 300 thousand graphs . moreover , our new method is faster than gspan when both can run in main memory .

v-miner : using enhanced parallel coordinates to mine product design and test data analyzing data to find trends , correlations , and stable patterns is an important task in many industrial applications . this paper proposes a new technique based on parallel coordinate visualization . previous work on parallel coordinate methods has shown that they are effective only when variables that are correlated and\/or show similar patterns are displayed adjacently . although current parallel coordinate tools allow the user to manually rearrange the order of variables , this process is very time-consuming when the number of variables is large . automated assistance is required . this paper introduces an edit-distance based technique to rearrange variables so that interesting change patterns can be easily detected visually . the visual miner ( v-miner ) software includes both automated methods for visualizing common patterns and a query tool that enables the user to describe specific target patterns to be mined or displayed by the system . in addition , the system can filter data according to rules sets imported from other data mining tools . this feature was found very helpful in practice , because it enables decision makers to visually identify interesting rules and data segments for further analysis or data mining . this paper begins with an introduction to the proposed techniques and the v-miner system . next , a case study illustrates how v-miner has been used at motorola to guide product design and test decisions .

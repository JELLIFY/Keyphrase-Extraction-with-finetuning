large human communication networks : patterns and a utility-driven generator given a real , and weighted person-to-person network which changes over time , what can we say about the cliques that it contains ? do the incidents of communication , or weights on the edges of a clique follow any pattern ? real , and in-person social networks have many more triangles than chance would dictate . as it turns out , there are many more cliques than one would expect , in surprising patterns . in this paper , we study massive real-world social networks formed by direct contacts among people through various personal communication services , such as phone-call , sms , im etc. . the contributions are the following : ( a ) we discover surprising patterns with the cliques , ( b ) we report power-laws of the weights on the edges of cliques , ( c ) our real networks follow these patterns such that we can trust them to spot outliers and finally , ( d ) we propose the first utility-driven graph generator for weighted time-evolving networks , which match the observed patterns . our study focused on three large datasets , each of which is a different type of communication service , with over one million records , and spans several months of activity .

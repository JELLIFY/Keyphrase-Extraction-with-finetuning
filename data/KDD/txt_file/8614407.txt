symp : an efficient clustering approach to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes in large data sets we propose a new clustering algorithm , called symp , which is based on synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators . symp represents each data point by an integrate-and-fire oscillator and uses the relative similarity between the points to model the interaction between the oscillators . symp is robust to noise and outliers , determines the number of clusters in an unsupervised manner , identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes , and can handle very large data sets . the robustness of symp is an intrinsic property of the synchronization mechanism . to determine the optimum number of clusters , symp uses a dynamic resolution parameter . to identify clusters of various shapes , symp models each cluster by multiple gaussian components . the number of components is automatically determined using a dynamic intra-cluster resolution parameter . clusters with simple shapes would be modeled by few components while clusters with more complex shapes would require a larger number of components . the scalable version of symp uses an efficient incremental approach that requires a simple pass through the data set . the proposed clustering approach is empirically evaluated with several synthetic and real data sets , and its performance is compared with cure .

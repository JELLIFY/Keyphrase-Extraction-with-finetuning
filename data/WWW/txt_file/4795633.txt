analyzing web access control policies xacml has emerged as a popular access control language on the web , but because of its rich expressiveness , it has proved difficult to analyze in an automated fashion . in this paper , we present a formalization of xacml using description logics ( dl ) , which are a decidable fragment of first-order logic . this formalization allows us to cover a more expressive subset of xacml than propositional logic-based analysis tools , and in addition we provide a new analysis service ( policy redundancy ) . also , mapping xacml to description logics allows us to use off-the-shelf dl reasoners for analysis tasks such as policy comparison , verification and querying . we provide empirical evaluation of a policy analysis tool that was implemented on top of open source dl reasoner pellet .

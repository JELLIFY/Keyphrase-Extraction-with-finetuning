a game based approach to assign geographical relevance to web images geographical context is very important for images . millions of images on the web have been already assigned latitude and longitude information . due to the rapid proliferation of such images with geographical context , it is still difficult to effectively search and browse them , since we do not have ways to decide their relevance . in this paper , we focus on the geographical relevance of images , which is defined as to what extent the main objects in an image match landmarks at the location where the image was taken . recently , researchers have proposed to use game based approaches to label large scale data such as web images . however , previous works have not shown the quality of collected game logs in detail and how the logs can improve existing applications . to answer these questions , we design and implement a web-based and multi-player game to collect human knowledge while people are enjoying the game . then we thoroughly analyze the game logs obtained during a three week study with 147 participants and propose methods to determine the image geographical relevance . in addition , we conduct an experiment to compare our methods with a commercial search engine . experimental results show that our methods dramatically improve image search relevance . furthermore , we show that we can derive geographically relevant objects and their salient portion in images , which is valuable for a number of applications such as image location recognition .

succinct summarization of transactional databases : an overlapped hyperrectangle scheme transactional data are ubiquitous . several methods , including frequent itemsets mining and co-clustering , have been proposed to analyze transactional databases . in this work , we propose a new research problem to succinctly summarize transactional databases . solving this problem requires linking the high level structure of the database to a potentially huge number of frequent itemsets . we formulate this problem as a set covering problem using overlapped hyperrectangles ; we then prove that this problem and its several variations are np-hard . we develop an approximation algorithm hyper which can achieve a ln ( k ) + 1 approximation ratio in polynomial time . we propose a pruning strategy that can significantly speed up the processing of our algorithm . additionally , we propose an efficient algorithm to further summarize the set of hyperrectangles by allowing false positive conditions . a detailed study using both real and synthetic datasets shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches in summarizing transactional databases .

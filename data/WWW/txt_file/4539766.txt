online mining of frequent query trees over xml data streams in this paper , we proposed an online algorithm , called fqt-stream ( frequent query trees of streams ) , to mine the set of all frequent tree patterns over a continuous xml data stream . a new numbering method is proposed to represent the tree structure of a xml query tree . an effective sub-tree numeration approach is developed to extract the essential information from the xml data stream . the extracted information is stored in an effective summary data structure . frequent query trees are mined from the current summary data structure by a depth-first-search manner .

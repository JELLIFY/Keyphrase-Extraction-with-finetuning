discovering word senses from text inventories of manually compiled dictionaries usually serve as a source for word senses . however , they often include many rare senses while missing corpus\/domain-specific senses . we present a clustering algorithm called cbc ( clustering by committee ) that automatically discovers word senses from text . it initially discovers a set of tight clusters called committees that are well scattered in the similarity space . the centroid of the members of a committee is used as the feature vector of the cluster . we proceed by assigning words to their most similar clusters . after assigning an element to a cluster , we remove their overlapping features from the element . this allows cbc to discover the less frequent senses of a word and to avoid discovering duplicate senses . each cluster that a word belongs to represents one of its senses . we also present an evaluation methodology for automatically measuring the precision and recall of discovered senses .

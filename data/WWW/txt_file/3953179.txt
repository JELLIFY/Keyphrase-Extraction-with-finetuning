web data extraction based on partial tree alignment this paper studies the problem of extracting data from a web page that contains several structured data records . the objective is to segment these data records , extract data items\/fields from them and put the data in a database table . this problem has been studied by several researchers . however , existing methods still have some serious limitations . the first class of methods is based on machine learning , which requires human labeling of many examples from each web site that one is interested in extracting data from . the process is time consuming due to the large number of sites and pages on the web . the second class of algorithms is based on automatic pattern discovery . these methods are either inaccurate or make many assumptions . this paper proposes a new method to perform the task automatically . it consists of two steps , ( 1 ) identifying individual data records in a page , and ( 2 ) aligning and extracting data items from the identified data records . for step 1 , we propose a method based on visual information to segment data records , which is more accurate than existing methods . for step 2 , we propose a novel partial alignment technique based on tree matching . partial alignment means that we align only those data fields in a pair of data records that can be aligned ( or matched ) with certainty , and make no commitment on the rest of the data fields . this approach enables very accurate alignment of multiple data records . experimental results using a large number of web pages from diverse domains show that the proposed two-step technique is able to segment data records , align and extract data from them very accurately .

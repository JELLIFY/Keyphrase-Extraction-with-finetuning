diversified scm standard for the japanese retail industry in this paper , we present the concept of a diversified scm ( supply chain management ) standard and distributed hub architecture which were used in b2b experiments for the japanese retail industry . the conventional concept of b2b standards develops a single ideal set of business transactions to be supported . in contrast , our concept allows a wide range of diverse business transaction patterns necessary for industry supply chains . an industry develops a standard scm model that partitions the whole supply chain into several transaction segments , each of which provides alternative business transaction patterns . for b2b collaboration , companies must agree on a collaboration configuration , which chooses the transaction alternatives from each segment . to support the development of a b2b system that executes an agreed collaboration , we introduce an soa ( service oriented architecture ) based pattern called a distributed hub architecture . as a hub of b2b collaboration , it includes a complete set of services that can process every possible business transaction included in a standard scm model . however , it does not function as a centralized service that coordinates participants . instead , it is deployed on every participant and executes the assigned part of the supply chain collaboratively with other distributed hubs . based on this concept , we analyzed actual business transactions in the japanese retail industry and developed a standard scm model , which represents more than a thousand possible transaction patterns . based on the model , we developed an experimental system for the japanese retail industry . the demonstration experiment involved major players in the industry including one of the largest general merchandise stores , one of the largest wholesalers , and major manufacturers in japan .

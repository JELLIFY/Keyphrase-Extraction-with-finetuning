k-ttp : a new privacy model for large-scale distributed environments secure multiparty computation allows parties to jointly compute a function of their private inputs without revealing anything but the output . theoretical results ( 2 ) provide a general construction of such protocols for any function . protocols obtained in this way are , however , inefficient , and thus , practically speaking , useless when a large number of participants are involved . the contribution of this paper is to define a new privacy model -- k-privacy -- by means of an innovative , yet natural generalization of the accepted trusted third party model . this allows implementing cryptographically secure efficient primitives for real-world large-scale distributed systems . as an example for the usefulness of the proposed model , we employ k-privacy to introduce a technique for obtaining knowledge -- by way of an association-rule mining algorithm -- from large-scale data grids , while ensuring that the privacy is cryptographically secure .

dealing with different distributions in learning from in the problem of learning with positive and unlabeled examples , existing research all assumes that positive examples p and the hidden positive examples in the unlabeled set u are generated from the same distribution . this assumption may be violated in practice . in such cases , existing methods perform poorly . this paper proposes a novel technique a-em to deal with the problem . experimental results with product page classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique .

active exploration for learning rankings from clickthrough data we address the task of learning rankings of documents from search enginelogs of user behavior . previous work on this problem has relied onpassively collected clickthrough data . in contrast , we show that anactive exploration strategy can provide data that leads to much fasterlearning . specifically , we develop a bayesian approach for selectingrankings to present users so that interactions result in more informativetraining data . our results using the trec-10 web corpus , as well assynthetic data , demonstrate that a directed exploration strategy quicklyleads to users being presented improved rankings in an online learningsetting . we find that active exploration substantially outperformspassive observation and random exploration .

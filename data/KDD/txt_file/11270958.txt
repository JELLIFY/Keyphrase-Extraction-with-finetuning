exploiting wikipedia as external knowledge for document clustering in traditional text clustering methods , documents are represented as `` bags of words '' without considering the semantic information of each document . for instance , if two documents use different collections of core words to represent the same topic , they may be falsely assigned to different clusters due to the lack of shared core words , although the core words they use are probably synonyms or semantically associated in other forms . the most common way to solve this problem is to enrich document representation with the background knowledge in an ontology . there are two major issues for this approach : ( 1 ) the coverage of the ontology is limited , even for wordnet or mesh , ( 2 ) using ontology terms as replacement or additional features may cause information loss , or introduce noise . in this paper , we present a novel text clustering method to address these two issues by enriching document representation with wikipedia concept and category information . we develop two approaches , exact match and relatedness-match , to map text documents to wikipedia concepts , and further to wikipedia categories . then the text documents are clustered based on a similarity metric which combines document content information , concept information as well as category information . the experimental results using the proposed clustering framework on three datasets ( 20-newsgroup , tdt2 , and la times ) show that clustering performance improves significantly by enriching document representation with wikipedia concepts and categories .

collaborative crawling : mining user experiences for topical resource discovery the rapid growth of the world wide web had made the problem of topic specific resource discovery an important one in recent years . in this problem , it is desired to find web pages which satisfy a predicate specified by the user . such a predicate could be a keyword query , a topical query , or some arbitrary contraint . several techniques such as focussed crawling and intelligent crawling have recently been proposed for topic specific resource discovery . all these crawlers are linkage based , since they use the hyperlink behavior in order to perform resource discovery . recent studies have shown that the topical correlations in hyperlinks are quite noisy and may not always show the consistency necessary for a reliable resource discovery process . in this paper , we will approach the problem of resource discovery from an entirely different perspective ; we will mine the significant browsing patterns of world wide web users in order to model the likelihood of web pages belonging to a specified predicate . this user behavior can be mined from the freely available traces of large public domain proxies on the world wide web . we refer to this technique as collaborative crawling because it mines the collective user experiences in order to find topical resources . such a strategy is extremely effective because the topical consistency in world wide web browsing patterns turns out to very reliable . in addition , the user-centered crawling system can be combined with linkage based systems to create an overall system which works more effectively than a system based purely on either user behavior or hyperlinks .

enhancing web search with entity intent web entities , such as documents and hyperlinks , are created for different purposes , or intents . existing intent-based retrieval methods largely focus on information seekers ' intent expressed by queries , ignoring the other side of the problem : web content creators ' intent . we argue that understanding why the content was created is also important . in this work , we propose to classify such intents into two broad categories : `` navigational '' and `` informational '' . then we incorporate such intents into traditional retrieval models , and show their effect on ranking performance .

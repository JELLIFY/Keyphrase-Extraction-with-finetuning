a management and performance framework for semantic web servers the unification of semantic web query languages under the sparql standard and the development of commercial-quality implementations are encouraging industries to use semantic technologies for managing information . current implementations , however , lack the performance monitoring and management services that the industry expects . in this paper , we present a performance and management framework interface to a generic sparql web server . we leverage existing standards for instrumentation to make the system ready-to-manage through existing monitoring applications , and we provide a performance framework which has the distinct feature of providing measurement results through the same sparql interface used to query data , eliminating the need for special interfaces .

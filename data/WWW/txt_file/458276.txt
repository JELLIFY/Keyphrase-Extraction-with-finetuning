index structures and algorithms for querying distributed rdf repositories a technical infrastructure for storing , querying and managing rdfdata is a key element in the current semantic web development . systems like jena , sesame or the ics-forth rdf suite are widelyused for building semantic web applications . currently , none ofthese systems supports the integrated querying of distributed rdf repositories . we consider this a major shortcoming since the semanticweb is distributed by nature . in this paper we present an architecture for querying distributed rdf repositories by extending the existing sesame system . we discuss the implications of our architectureand propose an index structure as well as algorithms forquery processing and optimization in such a distributed context .

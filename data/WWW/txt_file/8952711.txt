can link analysis tell us about web traffic ? in this paper we measure correlation between link analysis characteristics for web pages such as in - and out-degree , pagerank and rbs with those obtained from real web traffic analysis . measurements made on real data from the polish web show that pagerank is observably but not strongly correlated with actual visits made by web users to web pages and that our rbs algorithm ( 2 ) is more correlated with traffic data than pagerank in some cases .

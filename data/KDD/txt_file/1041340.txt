evaluating the novelty of text-mined rules using lexical knowledge in this paper , we present a new method of estimating the novelty of rules discovered by data-mining methods using wordnet , a lexical knowledge-base of english words . we assess the novelty of a rule by the average semantic distance in a knowledge hierarchy between the words in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule - the more the average distance , more is the novelty of the rule . the novelty of rules extracted by the discotex text-mining system on amazon.com book descriptions were evaluated by both human subjects and by our algorithm . by computing correlation coefficients between pairs of human ratings and between human and automatic ratings , we found that the automatic scoring of rules based on our novelty measure correlates with human judgments about as well as human judgments correlate with one another . @text mining

partitioning of web graphs by community topology we introduce a stricter web community definition to overcome boundary ambiguity of a web community defined by flake , lawrence and giles ( 2 ) , and consider the problem of finding communities that satisfy our definition . we discuss how to find such communities and hardness of this problem . we also propose web page partitioning by equivalence relation defined using the class of communities of our definition . though the problem of efficiently finding all communities of our definition is np-complete , we propose an efficient method of finding a subclass of communities among the sets partitioned by each of n-1 cuts represented by a gomory-hu tree ( 10 ) , and partitioning a web graph by equivalence relation defined using the subclass . according to our preliminary experiments , partitioning by our method divided the pages retrieved by keyword search into several different categories to some extent .

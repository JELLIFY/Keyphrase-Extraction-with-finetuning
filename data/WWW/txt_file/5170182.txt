performance of compressed inverted list caching in search engines due to the rapid growth in the size of the web , web search engines are facing enormous performance challenges . the larger engines in particular have to be able to process tens of thousands of queries per second on tens of billions of documents , making query throughput a critical issue . to satisfy this heavy workload , search engines use a variety of performance optimizations including index compression , caching , and early termination . we focus on two techniques , inverted index compression and index caching , which play a crucial rule in web search engines as well as other high-performance information retrieval systems . we perform a comparison and evaluation of several inverted list compression algorithms , including new variants of existing algorithms that have not been studied before . we then evaluate different inverted list caching policies on large query traces , and finally study the possible performance benefits of combining compression and caching . the overall goal of this paper is to provide an updated discussion and evaluation of these two techniques , and to show how to select the best set of approaches and settings depending on parameter such as disk speed and main memory cache size .

sparq2l : towards support for subgraph extraction queries in rdf databases many applications in analytical domains often have the need to `` connect the dots '' i.e. , query about the structure of data . in bioinformatics for example , it is typical to want to query about interactions between proteins . the aim of such queries is to `` extract '' relationships between entities i.e. paths from a data graph . often , such queries will specify certain constraints that qualifying results must satisfy e.g. paths involving a set of mandatory nodes . unfortunately , most present day semantic web query languages including the current draft of the anticipated recommendation sparql , lack the ability to express queries about arbitrary path structures in data . in addition , many systems that support some limited form of path queries rely on main memory graph algorithms limiting their applicability to very large scale graphs . in this paper , we present an approach for supporting path extraction queries . our proposal comprises ( i ) a query language sparq2l which extends sparql with path variables and path variable constraint expressions , and ( ii ) a novel query evaluation framework based on efficient algebraic techniques for solving path problems which allows for path queries to be efficiently evaluated on disk resident rdf graphs . the effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by a performance evaluation of our approach on both real world based and synthetic dataset .

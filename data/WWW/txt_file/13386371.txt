protocol-aware matching of web service interfaces for adapter development with the rapid growth in the number of online web services , the problem of service adaptation has received significant attention . in matching and adaptation , the functional description of services including interface and data as well as behavioral descriptions are important . existing work on matching and adaptation focuses only on one aspect . in this paper , we present a semi-automated matching approach that considers both service descriptions . we introduce two protocol-aware service interface matching algorithms , i.e. depth-based interface matching and iterative reference-based interface matching . these algorithms refine the results of interface matching by incorporating the ordering constraints imposed by business protocol definitions on service operations . we have implemented a prototype and performed experiments using the specification of synthetic and real-world web services . experiments show that the proposed approaches lead to a significant improvement in the quality of matching between services .

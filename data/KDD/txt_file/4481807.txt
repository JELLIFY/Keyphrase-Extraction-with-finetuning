evaluating similarity measures : a large-scale study in the orkut social network online information services have grown too large for users to navigate without the help of automated tools such as collaborative filtering , which makes recommendations to users based on their collective past behavior . while many similarity measures have been proposed and individually evaluated , they have not been evaluated relative to each other in a large real-world environment . we present an extensive empirical comparison of six distinct measures of similarity for recommending online communities to members of the orkut social network . we determine the usefulness of the different recommendations by actually measuring users ' propensity to visit and join recommended communities . we also examine how the ordering of recommendations influenced user selection , as well as interesting social issues that arise in recommending communities within a real social network .

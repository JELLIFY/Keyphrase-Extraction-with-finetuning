fragments of order high-dimensional collections of 0 -- 1 data occur in many applications . the attributes in such data sets are typically considered to be unordered . however , in many cases there is a natural total or partial order ≺ underlying the variables of the data set . examples of variables for which such orders exist include terms in documents , courses in enrollment data , and paleontological sites in fossil data collections . the observations in such applications are flat , unordered sets ; however , the data sets respect the underlying ordering of the variables . by this we mean that if a ≺ b ≺ c are three variables respecting the underlying ordering ≺ , and both of variables a and c appear in an observation , then , up to noise levels , variable b also appears in this observation . similarly , if a1 ≺ a2 ≺ ... ≺ al-1 ≺ ai is a longer sequence of variables , we do not expect to see many observations for which there are indices i ( j ( k such that ai and ak occur in the observation but aj does not . in this paper we study the problem of discovering fragments of orders of variables implicit in collections of unordered observations . we define measures that capture how well a given order agrees with the observed data . we describe a simple and efficient algorithm for finding all the fragments that satisfy certain conditions . we also discuss the sometimes necessary postprocessing for selecting only the best fragments of order . also , we relate our method with a sequencing approach that uses a spectral algorithm , and with the consecutive ones problem . we present experimental results on some real data sets ( author lists of database papers , exam results data , and paleontological data ) .

the paths more taken : matching dom trees to search logs for accurate webpage clustering an unsupervised clustering of the webpages on a website is a primary requirement for most wrapper induction and automated data extraction methods . since page content can vary drastically across pages of one cluster ( e.g. , all product pages on amazon.com ) , traditional clustering methods typically use some distance function between the dom trees representing a pair of webpages . however , without knowing which portions of the dom tree are `` important , '' such distance functions might discriminate between similar pages based on trivial features ( e.g. , differing number of reviews on two product pages ) , or club together distinct types of pages based on superficial features present in the dom trees of both ( e.g. , matching footer\/copyright ) , leading to poor clustering performance . we propose using search logs to automatically find paths in the dom trees that mark out important portions of pages , e.g. , the product title in a product page . such paths are identified via a global analysis of the entire website , whereby search data for popular pages can be used to infer good paths even for other pages that receive little or no search traffic . the webpages on the website are then clustered using these `` key '' paths . our algorithm only requires information on search queries , and the webpages clicked in response to them ; there is no need for human input , and it does not need to be told which portion of a webpage the user found interesting . the resulting clusterings achieve an adjusted rand score of over 0.9 on half of the websites ( a score of 1 indicating a perfect clustering ) , and 59 % better scores on average than competing algorithms . besides leading to refined clusterings , these key paths can be useful in the wrapper induction process itself , as shown by the high degree of match between the key paths and the manually identified paths used in existing wrappers for these sites ( 90 % average precision ) .

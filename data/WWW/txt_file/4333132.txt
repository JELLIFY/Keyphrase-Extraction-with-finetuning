explorations in the use of semantic web technologies for product information management master data refers to core business entities a company uses repeatedly across many business processes and systems ( such as lists or hierarchies of customers , suppliers , accounts , products , or organizational units ) . product information is the most important kind of master data and product information management ( pim ) is becoming critical for modern enterprises because it provides a rich business context for various applications . existing pim systems are less flexible and scalable for on-demand business , as well as too weak to completely capture and use the semantics of master data . this paper explores how to use semantic web technologies to enhance a collaborative pim system by simplifying modeling and representation while preserving enough dynamic flexibility . furthermore , we build a semantic pim system using one of the state-of-art ontology repositories and summarize the challenges we encountered based on our experimental results , especially on performance and scalability . we believe that our study and experiences are valuable for both semantic web community and master data management community .

distributed graph pattern matching graph simulation has been adopted for pattern matching to reduce the complexity and capture the need of novel applications . with the rapid development of the web and social networks , data is typically distributed over multiple machines . hence a natural question raised is how to evaluate graph simulation on distributed data . to our knowledge , no such distributed algorithms are in place yet . this paper settles this question by providing evaluation algorithms and optimizations for graph simulation in a distributed setting . ( 1 ) we study the impacts of components and data locality on the evaluation of graph simulation . ( 2 ) we give an analysis of a large class of distributed algorithms , captured by a message-passing model , for graph simulation . we also identify three complexity measures : visit times , makespan and data shipment , for analyzing the distributed algorithms , and show that these measures are essentially controversial with each other . ( 3 ) we propose distributed algorithms and optimization techniques that exploit the properties of graph simulation and the analyses of distributed algorithms . ( 4 ) we experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of these algorithms , using both real-life and synthetic data .

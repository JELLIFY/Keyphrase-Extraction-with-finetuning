texquery : a full-text search extension to xquery one of the key benefits of xml is its ability to represent a mix of structured and unstructured ( text ) data . although current xml query languages such as xpath and xquery can express rich queries over structured data , they can only express very rudimentary queries over text data . we thus propose texquery , which is a powerful full-text search extension to xquery . texquery provides a rich set of fully composable full-text search primitives , such as boolean connectives , phrase matching , proximity distance , stemming and thesauri . texquery also enables users to seamlessly query over both structured and text data by embedding texquery primitives in xquery , and vice versa . finally , texquery supports a flexible scoring construct that can be used toscore query results based on full-text predicates . texquery is the precursor ofthe full-text language extensions to xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 currently being developed by the w3c .

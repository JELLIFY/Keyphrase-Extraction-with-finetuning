blosom : a framework for mining arbitrary boolean expressions we introduce a novel framework , called blosom , for mining ( frequent ) boolean expressions over binary-valued datasets . we organize the space of boolean expressions into four categories : pure conjunctions , pure disjunctions , conjunction of disjunctions , and disjunction of conjunctions . we focus on mining the simplest expressions the minimal generators for each class . we also propose a closure operator for each class that yields closed boolean expressions . blosom efficiently mines frequent boolean expressions by utilizing a number of methodical pruning techniques . experiments showcase the behavior of blosom , and an application study on a real dataset is also given .

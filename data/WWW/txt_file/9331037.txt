a hybrid phish detection approach by identity discovery and keywords retrieval phishing is a significant security threat to the internet , which causes tremendous economic loss every year . in this paper , we proposed a novel hybrid phish detection method based on information extraction ( ie ) and information retrieval ( ir ) techniques . the identity-based component of our method detects phishing webpages by directly discovering the inconsistency between their identity and the identity they are imitating . the keywords-retrieval component utilizes ir algorithms exploiting the power of search engines to identify phish . our method requires no training data , no prior knowledge of phishing signatures and specific implementations , and thus is able to adapt quickly to constantly appearing new phishing patterns . comprehensive experiments over a diverse spectrum of data sources with 11449 pages show that both components have a low false positive rate and the stacked approach achieves a true positive rate of 90.06 % with a false positive rate of 1.95 % .

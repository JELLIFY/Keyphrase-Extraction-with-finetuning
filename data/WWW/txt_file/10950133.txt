regular expressions considered harmful in client-side xss filters cross-site scripting flaws have now surpassed buffer overflows as the world 's most common publicly-reported security vulnerability . in recent years , browser vendors and researchers have tried to develop client-side filters to mitigate these attacks . we analyze the best existing filters and find them to be either unacceptably slow or easily circumvented . worse , some of these filters could introduce vulnerabilities into sites that were previously bug-free . we propose a new filter design that achieves both high performance and high precision by blocking scripts after html parsing but before execution . compared to previous approaches , our approach is faster , protects against more vulnerabilities , and is harder for attackers to abuse . we have contributed an implementation of our filter design to the webkit open source rendering engine , and the filter is now enabled by default in the google chrome browser .

detecting soft errors by redirection classification a soft error redirection is a url redirection to a page that returns the http status code 200 ( ok ) but has actually no relevant content to the client request . since such redirections degrade the performance of web search engines in many ways , it is highly desirable to remove as many of them as possible . we propose a novel approach to detect soft error redirections by analyzing redirection logs collected during crawling operation . experimental results on huge crawl data show that our measure can classify soft error redirections effectively .

from actors , politicians , to ceos : domain adaptation of relational extractors using a latent relational mapping we propose a method to adapt an existing relation extraction system to extract new relation types with minimum supervision . our proposed method comprises two stages : learning a lower-dimensional projection between different relations , and learning a relational classifier for the target relation type with instance sampling . we evaluate the proposed method using a dataset that contains 2000 instances for 20 different relation types . our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a statistically significant macro-average f-score of 62.77 . moreover , the proposed method outperforms numerous baselines and a previously proposed weakly-supervised relation extraction method .

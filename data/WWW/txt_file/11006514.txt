scalable techniques for document identifier assignment in inverted indexes web search engines depend on the full-text inverted index data structure . because the query processing performance is so dependent on the size of the inverted index , a plethora of research has focused on fast end effective techniques for compressing this structure . recently , several authors have proposed techniques for improving index compression by optimizing the assignment of document identifiers to the documents in the collection , leading to significant reduction in overall index size . in this paper , we propose improved techniques for document identifier assignment . previous work includes simple and fast heuristics such as sorting by url , as well as more involved approaches based on the traveling salesman problem or on graph partitioning . these techniques achieve good compression but do not scale to larger document collections . we propose a new framework based on performing a traveling salesman computation on a reduced sparse graph obtained through locality sensitive hashing . this technique achieves improved compression while scaling to tens of millions of documents . based on this framework , we describe a number of new algorithms , and perform a detailed evaluation on three large data sets showing improvements in index size .

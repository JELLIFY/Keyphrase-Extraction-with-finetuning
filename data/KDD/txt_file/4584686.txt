characterising the difference characterising the differences between two databases is an often occurring problem in data mining . detection of change over time is a prime example , comparing databases from two branches is another one . the key problem is to discover the patterns that describe the difference . emerging patterns provide only a partial answer to this question . in previous work , we showed that the data distribution can be captured in a pattern-based model using compression ( 12 ) . here , we extend this approach to define a generic dissimilarity measure on databases . moreover , we show that this approach can identify those patterns that characterise the differences between two distributions . experimental results show that our method provides a well-founded way to independently measure database dissimilarity that allows for thorough inspection of the actual differences . this illustrates the use of our approach in real world data mining .

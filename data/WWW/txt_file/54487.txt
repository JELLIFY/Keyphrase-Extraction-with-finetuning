an infrastructure for searching , reusing and evolving distributed ontologies the vision of the semantic web can only be realized through proliferation of well-known ontologies describing different domains . to enable interoperability in the semantic web , it will be necessary to break these ontologies down into smaller , well-focused units that may be reused . currently , three problems arise in that scenario . firstly , it is difficult to locate ontologies to be reused , thus leading to many ontologies modeling the same thing . secondly , current tools do not provide means for reusing existing ontologies while building new ontologies . finally , ontologies are rarely static , but are being adapted to changing requirements . hence , an infrastructure for management of ontology changes , taking into account dependencies between ontologies is needed . in this paper we present such an infrastructure addressing the aforementioned problems .

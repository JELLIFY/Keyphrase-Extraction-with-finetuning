structured objects in owl : representation and reasoning applications of semantic technologies often require the representation of and reasoning with structured objects - that is , objects composed of parts connected in complex ways . although owl is a general and powerful language , its class descriptions and axioms can not be used to describe arbitrarily connected structures . an owl representation of structured objects can thus be underconstrained , which reduces the inferences that can be drawn and causes performance problems in reasoning . to address these problems , we extend owl with description graphs , which allow for the description of structured objects in a simple and precise way . to represent conditional aspects of the domain , we also allow for swrl-like rules over description graphs . based on an observation about the nature of structured objects , we ensure decidability of our formalism . we also present a hypertableau-based decision procedure , which we implemented in the hermit reasoner . to evaluate its performance , we have extracted description graphs from the galen and fma ontologies , classified them successfully , and even detected a modeling error in galen .

modeling relationships at multiple scales to improve accuracy of large recommender systems the collaborative filtering approach to recommender systems predicts user preferences for products or services by learning past user-item relationships . in this work , we propose novel algorithms for predicting user ratings of items by integrating complementary models that focus on patterns at different scales . at a local scale , we use a neighborhood-based technique that infers ratings from observed ratings by similar users or of similar items . unlike previous local approaches , our method is based on a formal model that accounts for interactions within the neighborhood , leading to improved estimation quality . at a higher , regional , scale , we use svd-like matrix factorization for recovering the major structural patterns in the user-item rating matrix . unlike previous approaches that require imputations in order to fill in the unknown matrix entries , our new iterative algorithm avoids imputation . because the models involve estimation of millions , or even billions , of parameters , shrinkage of estimated values to account for sampling variability proves crucial to prevent overfitting . both the local and the regional approaches , and in particular their combination through a unifying model , compare favorably with other approaches and deliver substantially better results than the commercial netflix cinematch recommender system on a large publicly available data set .

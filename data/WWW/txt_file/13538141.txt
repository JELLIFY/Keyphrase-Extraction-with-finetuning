exploiting web search to generate synonyms for entities tasks recognizing named entities such as products , people names , or locations from documents have recently received significant attention in the literature . many solutions to these tasks assume the existence of reference entity tables . an important challenge that needs to be addressed in the entity extraction task is that of ascertaining whether or not a candidate string approximately matches with a named entity in a given reference table . prior approaches have relied on string-based similarity which only compare a candidate string and an entity it matches with . in this paper , we exploit web search engines in order to define new similarity functions . we then develop efficient techniques to facilitate approximate matching in the context of our proposed similarity functions . in an extensive experimental evaluation , we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our techniques .

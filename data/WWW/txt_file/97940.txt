on deep annotation the success of the semantic web crucially depends on the easy creation , integration and use of semantic data . for this purpose , we consider an integration scenario that defies core assumptions of current metadata construction methods . we describe a framework of metadata creation when web pages are generated from a database and the database owner is cooperatively participating in the semantic web . this leads us to the definition of ontology mapping rules by manual semantic annotation and the usage of the mapping rules and of web services for semantic queries . in order to create metadata , the framework combines the presentation layer with the data description layer -- in contrast to `` conventional '' annotation , which remains at the presentation layer . therefore , we refer to the framework as deep annotation 1 . we consider deep annotation as particularly valid because , ( i ) , web pages generated from databases outnumber static web pages , ( ii ) , annotation of web pages may be a very intuitive way to create semantic data from a database and , ( iii ) , data from databases should not be materialized as rdf files , it should remain where it can be handled most efficiently -- in its databases .

malicious interface design : exploiting the user in an ideal world , interface design is the art and science of helping users accomplish tasks in a timely , efficient , and pleasurable manner . this paper studies the inverse situation , the vast emergence of deliberately constructed malicious interfaces that violate design best practices in order to accomplish goals counter to those of the user . this has become a commonplace occurrence both on and off the desktop , particularly on the web . a primary objective of this paper is to formally define this problem , including construction of a taxonomy of malicious interface techniques and a preliminary analysis of their impact on users . findings are presented that gauge the self-reported tolerance and expectation levels of users with regard to malicious interfaces as well as the effectiveness and ease of use of existing countermeasures . a second objective of this paper is to increase awareness , dialogue , and research in a domain that we consider largely unexplored but critical to future usability of the www . our results were accomplished through significant compilation of malicious interface techniques based on review of thousands of web sites and by conducting three surveys . ultimately , this paper concludes that malicious interfaces are a ubiquitous problem that demands intervention by the security and human computer interaction communities in order to reduce the negative impact on the global user population .

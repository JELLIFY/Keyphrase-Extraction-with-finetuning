clustering spatial data using random walks discovering significant patterns that exist implicitly in huge spatial databases is an important computational task . a common approach to this problem is to use cluster analysis . we propose a novel approach to clustering , based on the deterministic analysis of random walks on a weighted graph generated from the data . our approach can decompose the data into arbitrarily shaped clusters of different sizes and densities , overcoming noise and outliers that may blur the natural decomposition of the data . the method requires only o ( n log n ) time , and one of its variants needs only constant space .

mining unexpected rules by pushing user dynamics unexpected rules are interesting because they are either previously unknown or deviate from what prior user knowledge would suggest . in this paper , we study three important issues that have been previously ignored in mining unexpected rules . first , the unexpectedness of a rule depends on how the user prefers to apply the prior knowledge to a given scenario , in addition to the knowledge itself . second , the prior knowledge should be considered right from the start to focus the search on unexpected rules . third , the unexpectedness of a rule depends on what other rules the user has seen so far . thus , only rules that remain unexpected given what the user has seen should be considered interesting . we develop an approach that addresses all three problems above and evaluate it by means of experiments focusing on finding interesting rules .

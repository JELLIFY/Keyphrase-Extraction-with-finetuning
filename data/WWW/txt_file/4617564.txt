exploring social annotations for the semantic web in order to obtain a machine understandable semantics for web resources , research on the semantic web tries to annotate web resources with concepts and relations from explicitly defined formal ontologies . this kind of formal annotation is usually done manually or semi-automatically . in this paper , we explore a complement approach that focuses on the `` social annotations of the web '' which are annotations manually made by normal web users without a pre-defined formal ontology . compared to the formal annotations , although social annotations are coarse-grained , informal and vague , they are also more accessible to more people and better reflect the web resources ' meaning from the users ' point of views during their actual usage of the web resources . using a social bookmark service as an example , we show how emergent semantics ( 2 ) can be statistically derived from the social annotations . furthermore , we apply the derived emergent semantics to discover and search shared web bookmarks . the initial evaluation on our implementation shows that our method can effectively discover semantically related web bookmarks that current social bookmark service can not discover easily .

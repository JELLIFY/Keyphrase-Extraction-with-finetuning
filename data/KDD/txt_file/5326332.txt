ilink : search and routing in social networks the growth of web 2.0 and fundamental theoretical breakthroughs have led to an avalanche of interest in social networks . this paper focuses on the problem of modeling how social networks accomplish tasks through peer production style collaboration . we propose a general interaction model for the underlying social networks and then a specific model ( ilink for social search and message routing . a key contribution here is the development of a general learning framework for making such online peer production systems work at scale . the ilink model has been used to develop a system for faq generation in a social network ( faqtory ) , and experience with its application in the context of a full-scale learning-driven workflow application ( calo ) is reported . we also discuss methods of adapting ilink technology for use in military knowledge sharing portals and other message routing systems . finally , the paper shows the connection of ilink to sqm , a theoretical model for social search that is a generalization of markov decision processes and the popular pagerank model .

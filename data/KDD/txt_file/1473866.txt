adaptive duplicate detection using learnable string similarity measures the problem of identifying approximately duplicate records in databases is an essential step for data cleaning and data integration processes . most existing approaches have relied on generic or manually tuned distance metrics for estimating the similarity of potential duplicates . in this paper , we present a framework for improving duplicate detection using trainable measures of textual similarity . we propose to employ learnable text distance functions for each database field , and show that such measures are capable of adapting to the specific notion of similarity that is appropriate for the field 's domain . we present two learnable text similarity measures suitable for this task : an extended variant of learnable string edit distance , and a novel vector-space based measure that employs a support vector machine ( svm ) for training . experimental results on a range of datasets show that our framework can improve duplicate detection accuracy over traditional techniques .

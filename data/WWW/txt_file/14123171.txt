active objects : actions for entity-centric search we introduce an entity-centric search experience , called active objects , in which entity-bearing queries are paired with actions that can be performed on the entities . for example , given a query for a specific flashlight , we aim to present actions such as reading reviews , watching demo videos , and finding the best price online . in an annotation study conducted over a random sample of user query sessions , we found that a large proportion of queries in query logs involve actions on entities , calling for an automatic approach to identifying relevant actions for entity-bearing queries . in this paper , we pose the problem of finding actions that can be performed on entities as the problem of probabilistic inference in a graphical model that captures how an entity bearing query is generated . we design models of increasing complexity that capture latent factors such as entity type and intended actions that determine how a user writes a query in a search box , and the url that they click on . given a large collection of real-world queries and clicks from a commercial search engine , the models are learned efficiently through maximum likelihood estimation using an em algorithm . given a new query , probabilistic inference enables recommendation of a set of pertinent actions and hosts . we propose an evaluation methodology for measuring the relevance of our recommended actions , and show empirical evidence of the quality and the diversity of the discovered actions .

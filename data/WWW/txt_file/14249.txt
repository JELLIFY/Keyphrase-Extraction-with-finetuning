design of a crawler with bounded bandwidth this paper presents an algorithm to bound the bandwidth of a web crawler . the crawler collects statistics on the transfer rate of each server to predict the expected bandwidth use for future downloads . the prediction allows us to activate the optimal number of fetcher threads in order to exploit the assigned bandwidth . the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique .

segmentation-based modeling for advanced targeted marketing fingerhut business intelligence ( bi ) has a long and successful history of building statistical models to predict consumer behavior . the models constructed are typically segmentation-based models in which the target audience is split into subpopulations ( i.e. , customer segments ) and individually tailored statistical models are then developed for each segment . such models are commonly employed in the direct-mail industry ; however , segmentation is often performed on an ad-hoc basis without directly considering how segmentation affects the accuracy of the resulting segment models . fingerhut bi approached ibm research with the problem of how to build segmentation-based models more effectively so as to maximize predictive accuracy . the ibm advanced targeted marketing-single eventstm ( ibm atm-setm ) solution is the result of ibm research and fingerhut bi directing their efforts jointly towards solving this problem . this paper presents an evaluation of atm-se 's modeling capabilities using data from fingerhut 's catalog mailings .

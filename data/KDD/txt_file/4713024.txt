detecting outliers using transduction and statistical testing outlier detection can uncover malicious behavior in fields like intrusion detection and fraud analysis . although there has been a significant amount of work in outlier detection , most of the algorithms proposed in the literature are based on a particular definition of outliers ( e.g. , density-based ) , and use ad-hoc thresholds to detect them . in this paper we present a novel technique to detect outliers with respect to an existing clustering model . however , the test can also be successfully utilized to recognize outliers when the clustering information is not available . our method is based on transductive confidence machines , which have been previously proposed as a mechanism to provide individual confidence measures on classification decisions . the test uses hypothesis testing to prove or disprove whether a point is fit to be in each of the clusters of the model . we experimentally demonstrate that the test is highly robust , and produces very few misdiagnosed points , even when no clustering information is available . furthermore , our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method under the circumstances of data contaminated by outliers . we finally show that our technique can be successfully applied to identify outliers in a noisy data set for which no information is available ( e.g. , ground truth , clustering structure , etc. ) . as such our proposed methodology is capable of bootstrapping from a noisy data set a clean one that can be used to identify future outliers .

catching the drift : learning broad matches from clickthrough data identifying similar keywords , known as broad matches , is an important task in online advertising that has become a standard feature on all major keyword advertising platforms . effective broad matching leads to improvements in both relevance and monetization , while increasing advertisers ' reach and making campaign management easier . in this paper , we present a learning-based approach to broad matching that is based on exploiting implicit feedback in the form of advertisement clickthrough logs . our method can utilize arbitrary similarity functions by incorporating them as features . we present an online learning algorithm , amnesiac averaged perceptron , that is highly efficient yet able to quickly adjust to the rapidly-changing distributions of bidded keywords , advertisements and user behavior . experimental results obtained from ( 1 ) historical logs and ( 2 ) live trials on a large-scale advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the overall success of our approach in identifying high-quality broad match mappings .

sgps : a semantic scheme for web service similarity today 's web becomes a platform for services to be dynamically interconnected to produce a desired outcome . it is important to formalize the semantics of the contextual elements of web services . in this paper , we propose a novel technique called semantic genome propagation scheme ( sgps ) for measuring similarity between semantic concepts . we show how sgps is used to compute a multi-dimensional similarity between two services . we evaluate the sgps similarity measurement in terms of the similarity performance and scalability .

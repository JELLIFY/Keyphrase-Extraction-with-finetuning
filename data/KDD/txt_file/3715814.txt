automatic mining of fruit fly embryo images we present femine , an automatic system for image-based gene expression analysis . we perform experiments on the largest publicly available collection of drosophila ish ( in situ hybridization ) images , showing that our femine system achieves excellent performance in classification , clustering , and content-based image retrieval . the major innovation of femine is the use of automatically discovered latent spatial `` themes '' of gene expressions , lges , in the whole-embryo context , as opposed to patterns in nearly disjoint portions of an embryo proposed in previous methods .

classifying web sites in this paper , we present a novel method for the classification of web sites . this method exploits both structure and content of web sites in order to discern their functionality . it allows for distinguishing between eight of the most relevant functional classes of web sites . we show that a pre-classification of web sites utilizing structural properties considerably improves a subsequent textual classification with standard techniques . we evaluate this approach on a dataset comprising more than 16,000 web sites with about 20 million crawled and 100 million known web pages . our approach achieves an accuracy of 92 % for the coarse-grained classification of these web sites .

fine grained content-based adaptation mechanism for providing high end-user quality of experience with adaptive hypermedia systems new communication technologies can enable web users to access personalised information `` anytime , anywhereö . however , the network environments allowing this `` anytime , anywhereö access may have widely varying performance characteristics such as bandwidth , level of congestion , mobility support , and cost of transmission . it is unrealistic to expect that the quality of delivery of the same content can be maintained in this variable environment , but rather an effort must be made to fit the content served to the current delivery conditions , thus ensuring high quality of experience ( qoe ) to the users . this paper introduces an end-user qoe-aware adaptive hypermedia framework that extends the adaptation functionality of adaptive hypermedia systems with a fine-grained content-based adaptation mechanism . the proposed mechanism attempts to take into account multiple factors affecting qoe in relation to the delivery of web content . various simulation tests investigate the performance improvements provided by this mechanism , in a home-like , low bit rate operational environment , in terms of access time per page , aggregate access time per browsing session and quantity of transmitted information .

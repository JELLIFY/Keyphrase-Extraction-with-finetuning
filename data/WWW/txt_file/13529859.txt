automatically filling form-based web interfaces with free text inputs on the web of today the most prevalent solution for users to interact with data-intensive applications is the use of form-based interfaces composed by several data input fields , such as text boxes , radio buttons , pull-down lists , check boxes , etc. . although these interfaces are popular and effective , in many cases , free text interfaces are preferred over form-based ones . in this paper we discuss the proposal and the implementation of a novel ir-based method for using data rich free text to interact with form-based interfaces . our solution takes a free text as input , extracts implicitly data values from it and fills appropriate fields using them . for this task , we rely on values of previous submissions for each field , which are freely obtained from the usage of form-based interfaces

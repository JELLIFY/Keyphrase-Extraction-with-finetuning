semantic analytics on social networks : experiences in addressing the problem of conflict of interest detection in this paper , we describe a semantic web application that detects conflict of interest ( coi ) relationships among potential reviewers and authors of scientific papers . this application discovers various ` semantic associations ' between the reviewers and authors in a populated ontology to determine a degree of conflict of interest . this ontology was created by integrating entities and relationships from two social networks , namely `` knows , '' from a foaf ( friend-of-a-friend ) social network and `` co-author , '' from the underlying co-authorship network of the dblp bibliography . we describe our experiences developing this application in the context of a class of semantic web applications , which have important research and engineering challenges in common . in addition , we present an evaluation of our approach for real-life coi detection .

single-shot detection of multiple categories of text using parametric mixture models in this paper , we address the problem of detecting multiple topics or categories of text where each text is not assumed to belong to one of a number of mutually exclusive categories . conventionally , the binary classification approach has been employed , in which whether or not text belongs to a category is judged by the binary classifier for every category . in this paper , we propose a more sophisticated approach to simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using parametric mixture models ( pmms ) , newly presented in this paper . pmms are probabilistic generative models for text that has multiple categories . our pmms are essentially different from the conventional mixture of multinomial distributions in the sense that in the former several basis multinomial parameters are mixed in the parameter space , while in the latter several multinomial components are mixed . we derive efficient learning algorithms for pmms within the framework of the maximum a posteriori estimate . we also empirically show that our method can outperform the conventional binary approach when applied to multitopic detection of world wide web pages , focusing on those from the `` yahoo.com '' domain .

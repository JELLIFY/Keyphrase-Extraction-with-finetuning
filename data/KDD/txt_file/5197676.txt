disease progression modeling from historical clinical databases this paper considers the problem of modeling disease progression from historical clinical databases , with the ultimate objective of stratifying patients into groups with clearly distinguishable prognoses or suitability for different treatment strategies . to meet this objective , we describe a procedure that first fits clinical variables measured over time to a disease progression model . the resulting parameter estimates are then used as the basis for a stepwise clustering procedure to stratify patients into groups with distinct survival characteristics . as a practical illustration , we apply this procedure to survival prediction , using a liver transplant database from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases ( niddk ) .

detecting the origin of text segments efficiently in the origin detection problem an algorithm is given a set s of documents , ordered by creation time , and a query document d. it needs to output for every consecutive sequence of k alphanumeric terms in d the earliest document in $ s$ in which the sequence appeared ( if such a document exists ) . algorithms for the origin detection problem can , for example , be used to detect the `` origin '' of text segments in d and thus to detect novel content in d. they can also find the document from which the author of d has copied the most ( or show that d is mostly original . ) we concentrate on solutions that use only a fixed amount of memory . we propose novel algorithms for this problem and evaluate them together with a large number of previously published algorithms . our results show that ( 1 ) detecting the origin of text segments efficiently can be done with very high accuracy even when the space used is less than 1 % of the size of the documents in $ s$ , ( 2 ) the precision degrades smoothly with the amount of available space , ( 3 ) various estimation techniques can be used to increase the performance of the algorithms .

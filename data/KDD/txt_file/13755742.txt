on community outliers and their efficient detection in information networks linked or networked data are ubiquitous in many applications . examples include web data or hypertext documents connected via hyperlinks , social networks or user profiles connected via friend links , co-authorship and citation information , blog data , movie reviews and so on . in these datasets ( called `` information networks '' ) , closely related objects that share the same properties or interests form a community . for example , a community in blogsphere could be users mostly interested in cell phone reviews and news . outlier detection in information networks can reveal important anomalous and interesting behaviors that are not obvious if community information is ignored . an example could be a low-income person being friends with many rich people even though his income is not anomalously low when considered over the entire population . this paper first introduces the concept of community outliers ( interesting points or rising stars for a more positive sense ) , and then shows that well-known baseline approaches without considering links or community information can not find these community outliers . we propose an efficient solution by modeling networked data as a mixture model composed of multiple normal communities and a set of randomly generated outliers . the probabilistic model characterizes both data and links simultaneously by defining their joint distribution based on hidden markov random fields ( hmrf ) . maximizing the data likelihood and the posterior of the model gives the solution to the outlier inference problem . we apply the model on both synthetic data and dblp data sets , and the results demonstrate importance of this concept , as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach .

improving predictions using aggregate information in domains such as consumer products or manufacturing amongst others , we have problems that warrant the prediction of a continuous target . besides the usual set of explanatory attributes we may also have exact ( or approximate ) estimates of aggregated targets , which are the sums of disjoint sets of individual targets that we are trying to predict . hence , the question now becomes can we use these aggregated targets , which are a coarser piece of information , to improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets ? in this paper , we provide a simple yet provable way of accomplishing this . in particular , given predictions from any regression model of the target on the test data , we elucidate a provable method for improving these predictions in terms of mean squared error , given exact ( or accurate enough ) information of the aggregated targets . these estimates of the aggregated targets may be readily available or obtained -- through multilevel regression -- at different levels of granularity . based on the proof of our method we suggest a criterion for choosing the appropriate level . moreover , in addition to estimates of the aggregated targets , if we have exact ( or approximate ) estimates of the mean and variance of the target distribution , then based on our general strategy we provide an optimal way of incorporating this information so as to further improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets . we then validate the results and our claims by conducting experiments on synthetic and real industrial data obtained from diverse domains .

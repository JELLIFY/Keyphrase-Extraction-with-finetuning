authoring and annotation of web pages in cream richly interlinked , machine-understandable data constitute the basis for the semantic web . we provide a framework , cream , that allows for creation of metadata . while the annotation mode of cream allows to create metadata for existing web pages , the authoring mode lets authors create metadata -- almost for free -- while putting together the content of a page . as a particularity of our framework , cream allows to create relational metadata , i.e. metadata that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively rigid template-like schema asm dublin core . we discuss some of the requirements one has to meet when developing such an ontology-based framework , e.g. the integration of a metadata crawler , inference services , document management and a meta-ontology , and describe its implementation , viz . ont-o-mat , a component-based , ontology-driven web page authoring and annotation tool .

generalized clustering , supervised learning , and data assignment clustering algorithms have become increasingly important in handling and analyzing data . considerable work has been done in devising effective but increasingly specific clustering algorithms . in contrast , we have developed a generalized framework that accommodates diverse clustering algorithms in a systematic way . this framework views clustering as a general process of iterative optimization that includes modules for supervised learning and instance assignment . the framework has also suggested several novel clustering methods . in this paper , we investigate experimentally the efficacy of these algorithms and test some hypotheses about the relation between such unsupervised techniques and the supervised methods embedded in them .

building term suggestion relational graphs from collective intelligence this paper proposes an effective approach to provide relevant search terms for conceptual web search . ` semantic term suggestion ' function has been included so that users can find the most appropriate query term to what they really need . conventional approaches for term suggestion involve extracting frequently occurring key terms from retrieved documents . they must deal with term extraction difficulties and interference from irrelevant documents . in this paper , we propose a semantic term suggestion function called collective intelligence based term suggestion ( cits ) . cits provides a novel social-network based framework for relevant terms suggestion with a semantic graph of the search term without limiting to the specific query term . a visualization of semantic graph is presented to the users to help browsing search results from related terms in the semantic graph . the search results are ranked each time according to their relevance to the related terms in the entire query session . comparing to two popular commercial search engines , a user study of 18 users on 50 search terms showed better user satisfactions and indicated the potential usefulness of proposed method in real-world search applications .

price modeling in standards for electronic product catalogs based on xml the fast spreading of electronic business-to-business procurement systems has led to the development of new standards for the exchange of electronic product catalogs ( e-catalogs ) . e-catalogs contain various information about products , essential is price information . prices are used for buying decisions and following order transactions . while simple price models are often sufficient for the description of indirect goods ( e.g. office supplies ) , other goods and lines of business make higher demands . in this paper we examine what price information is contained in commercial xml standards for the exchange of product catalog data . for that purpose we bring the different implicit price models of the examined catalog standards together and provide a generalized model .

e-learning personalization based on itineraries and long-term navigational behavior in this paper we describe a practical framework for studying then a navigational behavior of the users of an e-learning environment integrated in a virtual campus . the students navigate through the web based virtual campus interacting with learning resources which are structured following the scorm e-learning standard . our main goal is to design a usage mining tool for analyzing such user navigational behavior and for extracting relevant information that can be used to validate several aspects related to virtual campus design and usability but also to determine the optimal scheduling for each course depending on user profile . we intend to extend these quencing capabilities of the scorm standard to include the concept of recommended itinerary , by combining teachers expertise with learned experience acquired by system usage analysis .

p-tag : large scale automatic generation of personalized annotation tags for the web the success of the semantic web depends on the availability of web pages annotated with metadata . free form metadata or tags , as used in social bookmarking and folksonomies , have become more and more popular and successful . such tags are relevant keywords associated with or assigned to a piece of information ( e.g. , a web page ) , describing the item and enabling keyword-based classification . in this paper we propose p-tag , a method which automatically generates personalized tags for web pages . upon browsing a web page , p-tag produces keywords relevant both to its textual content , but also to the data residing on the surfer 's desktop , thus expressing a personalized viewpoint . empirical evaluations with several algorithms pursuing this approach showed very promising results . we are therefore very confident that such a user oriented automatic tagging approach can provide large scale personalized metadata annotations as an important step towards realizing the semantic web .

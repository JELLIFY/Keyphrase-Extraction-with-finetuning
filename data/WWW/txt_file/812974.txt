topical trustrank : using topicality to combat web spam web spam is behavior that attempts to deceive search engine ranking algorithms . trustrank is a recent algorithm that can combat web spam . however , trustrank is vulnerable in the sense that the seed set used by trustrank may not be sufficiently representative to cover well the different topics on the web . also , for a given seed set , trustrank has a bias towards larger communities . we propose the use of topical information to partition the seed set and calculate trust scores for each topic separately to address the above issues . a combination of these trust scores for a page is used to determine its ranking . experimental results on two large datasets show that our topical trustrank has a better performance than trustrank in demoting spam sites or pages . compared to trustrank , our best technique can decrease spam from the top ranked sites by as much as 43.1 % .

extraction and search of chemical formulae in text documents on the web often scientists seek to search for articles on the web related to a particular chemical . when a scientist searches for a chemical formula using a search engine today , she gets articles where the exact keyword string expressing the chemical formula is found . searching for the exact occurrence of keywords during searching results in two problems for this domain : a ) if the author searches for ch4 and the article has h4c , the article is not returned , and b ) ambiguous searches like `` he '' return all documents where helium is mentioned as well as documents where the pronoun `` he '' occurs . to remedy these deficiencies , we propose a chemical formula search engine . to build a chemical formula search engine , we must solve the following problems : 1 ) extract chemical formulae from text documents , 2 ) index chemical formulae , and 3 ) designranking functions for the chemical formulae . furthermore , query models are introduced for formula search , and for each a scoring scheme based on features of partial formulae is proposed tomeasure the relevance of chemical formulae and queries . we evaluate algorithms for identifying chemical formulae in documents using classification methods based on support vector machines ( svm ) , and a probabilistic model based on conditional random fields ( crf ) . different methods for svm and crf to tune the trade-off between recall and precision forim balanced data are proposed to improve the overall performance . a feature selection method based on frequency and discrimination isused to remove uninformative and redundant features . experiments show that our approaches to chemical formula extraction work well , especially after trade-off tuning . the results also demonstrate that feature selection can reduce the index size without changing ranked query results much .

discovering the set of fundamental rule changes the world around us changes constantly . knowing what has changed is an important part of our lives . for businesses , recognizing changes is also crucial . it allows businesses to adapt themselves to the changing market needs . in this paper , we study changes of association rules from one time period to another . one approach is to compare the supports and\/or confidences of each rule in the two time periods and report the differences . this technique , however , is too simplistic as it tends to report a huge number of rule changes , and many of them are , in fact , simply the snowball effect of a small subset of fundamental changes . here , we present a technique to highlight the small subset of fundamental changes . a change is fundamental if it can not be explained by some other changes . the proposed technique has been applied to a number of real-life datasets . experiments results show that the number of rules whose changes are unexplainable is quite small ( about 20 % of the total number of changes discovered ) , and many of these unexplainable changes reflect some fundamental shifts in the application domain .

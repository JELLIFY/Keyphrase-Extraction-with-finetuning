reactive rules inference from dynamic dependency models defining dependency models is sometimes an easier , more intuitive way for ontology representation than defining reactive rules directly , as it provides a higher level of abstraction . we will shortly introduce the adi ( active dependency integration ) model capabilities , emphasizing new developments : 1 . support of automatic dependencies instantiation from an abstract definition that expresses a general dependency in the ontology , namely a `` template '' . 2 . inference of rules for dynamic dependency models where dependencies and entities may be inserted deleted and updated . we use the etrade example in order to exemplify those capabilities .

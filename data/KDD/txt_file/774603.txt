discovering significant opsm subspace clusters in massive gene expression data order-preserving submatrixes ( opsms ) have been accepted as a biologically meaningful subspace cluster model , capturing the general tendency of gene expressions across a subset of conditions . in an opsm , the expression levels of all genes induce the same linear ordering of the conditions . opsm mining is reducible to a special case of the sequential pattern mining problem , in which a pattern and its supporting sequences uniquely specify an opsm cluster . those small twig clusters , specified by long patterns with naturally low support , incur explosive computational costs and would be completely pruned off by most existing methods for massive datasets containing thousands of conditions and hundreds of thousands of genes , which are common in today 's gene expression analysis . however , it is in particular interest of biologists to reveal such small groups of genes that are tightly coregulated under many conditions , and some pathways or processes might require only two genes to act in concert . in this paper , we introduce the kiwi mining framework for massive datasets , that exploits two parameters k and w to provide a biased testing on a bounded number of candidates , substantially reducing the search space and problem scale , targeting on highly promising seeds that lead to significant clusters and twig clusters . extensive biological and computational evaluations on real datasets demonstrate that kiwi can effectively mine biologically meaningful opsm subspace clusters with good efficiency and scalability .

web mashup scripting language the web mashup scripting language ( wmsl ) enables an end-user ( you ) working from his browser , e.g. not needing any other infrastructure , to quickly write mashups that integrate any two , or more , web services on the web . the end-user accomplishes this by writing a web page that combines html , metadata in the form of mapping relations , and small piece of code , or script . the mapping relations enable not only the discovery and retrieval of the wmsl pages , but also affect a new programming paradigm that abstracts many programming complexities from the script writer . furthermore , the wmsl web pages or scripts that disparate end-users ( you ) write , can be harvested by crawlers to automatically generate the concepts needed to build lightweight ontologies containing local semantics of a web service and its data model , to extend context ontologies or middle ontologies , and to develop links , or mappings , between these ontologies . this enables an open-source model of building ontologies based on the wmsl web page or scripts that end users ( you ) write .

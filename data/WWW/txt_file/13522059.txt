web service derivatives web service development and usage has shifted from simple information processing services to high-value business services that are crucial to productivity and success . in order to deal with an increasing risk of unavailability or failure of mission-critical web services we argue the need for advanced reservation of services in the form of derivatives . the contribution of this paper is twofold : first we provide an abstract model of a market design that enables the trade of derivatives for mission-critical web services . our model satisfies requirements that result from service characteristics such as intangibility and the impossibility to inventor services in order to meet fluctuating demand . it comprehends principles from models of incomplete markets such as the absence of a tradeable underlying and consistent arbitrage-free derivative pricing . furthermore we provide an architecture for a web service market that implements our model and describes the strategy space and interaction of market participants in the trading process of service derivatives . we compare the underlying pricing processes to existing derivative models in energy exchanges , discuss eventual shortcomings , and apply wavelets to analyze actual data and extract long - and short-term trends .

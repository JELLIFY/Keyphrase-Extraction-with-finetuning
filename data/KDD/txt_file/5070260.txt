exploiting duality in summarization with deterministic guarantees summarization is an important task in data mining . a major challenge over the past years has been the efficient construction of fixed-space synopses that provide a deterministic quality guarantee , often expressed in terms of a maximum-error metric . histograms and several hierarchical techniques have been proposed for this problem . however , their time and\/or space complexities remain impractically high and depend not only on the data set size n , but also on the space budget b. these handicaps stem from a requirement to tabulate all allocations of synopsis space to different regions of the data . in this paper we develop an alternative methodology that dispels these deficiencies , thanks to a fruitful application of the solution to the dual problem : given a maximum allowed error , determine the minimum-space synopsis that achieves it . compared to the state-of-the-art , our histogram construction algorithm reduces time complexity by ( at least ) a blog2n over logε \* factor and our hierarchical synopsis algorithm reduces the complexity by ( at least ) a factor of log2b over logε \* + logn in time and b ( 1-log b over log n ) in space , where ε \* is the optimal error . these complexity advantages offer both a space-efficiency and a scalability that previous approaches lacked . we verify the benefits of our approach in practice by experimentation .

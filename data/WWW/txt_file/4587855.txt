invisible participants : how cultural capital relates to lurking behavior the asymmetry of activity in virtual communities is of great interest . while participation in the activities of virtual communities is crucial for a community 's survival and development , many people prefer lurking , that is passive attention over active participation . lurking can be measured and perhaps affected by both dispositional and situational variables . this work investigates the concept of cultural capital as situational antecedent of lurking and de-lurking ( the decision to start posting after a certain amount of lurking time ) . cultural capital is defined as the knowledge that enables an individual to interpret various cultural codes . the main hypothesis states that a user 's cultural capital affects her level of activity in a community and her decision to de-lurk and cease to exist in very active communities because of information overload . this hypothesis is analyzed by mathematically defining a social communication network ( scn ) of activities in authenticated discussion forums . we validate this model by examining the scn using data collected in a sample of 636 online forums in open university in israel and 2 work based communities from ibm . the hypotheses verified here make it clear that fostering receptive participation may be as important and constructive as encouraging active contributions in online communities .

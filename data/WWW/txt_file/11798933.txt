dynamic and graphical web page breakpoints breakpoints are perhaps the quintessential feature of a de-bugger : they allow a developer to stop time and study the program state . breakpoints are typically specified by selecting a line of source code . for large , complex , web pages with multiple developers , the relevant source line for a given user interface problem may not be known to the developer . in this paper we describe the implementation of breakpoints in dynamically created source , and on error messages , network events , dommutation , domobject property changes , and css style rule updates . adding these domain-specific breakpoints to a general-purpose debugger for javascript allows the developer to initiate the debugging process via web page abstractions rather than lower level source code views . the breakpoints are implemented in the open source fire-bug project , version 1.5 , for the firefox web browser .

addressing the testing challenge with a web-based e-assessment system that tutors as it assesses secondary teachers across the country are being asked to use formative assessment data to inform their classroom instruction . at the same time , critics of no child left behind are calling the bill `` no child left untested√∂ emphasizing the negative side of assessment , in that every hour spent assessing students is an hour lost from instruction . or does it have to be ? what if we better integrated assessment into the classroom , and we allowed students to learn during the test ? maybe we could even provide tutoring on the steps of solving problems . our hypothesis is that we can achieve more accurate assessment by not only using data on whether students get test items right or wrong , but by also using data on the effort required for students to learn how to solve a test item . we provide evidence for this hypothesis using data collected with our e-assistment system by more than 600 students over the course of the 2004-2005 school year . we also show that we can track student knowledge over time using modern longitudinal data analysis techniques . in a separate paper ( 9 ) , we report on the assistment system 's architecture and scalability , while this paper is focused on how we can reliably assess student learning .

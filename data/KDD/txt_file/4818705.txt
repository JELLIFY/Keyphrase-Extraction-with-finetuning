optimizing time series discretization for knowledge discovery knowledge discovery in time series usually requires symbolic time series . many discretization methods that convert numeric time series to symbolic time series ignore the temporal order of values . this often leads to symbols that do not correspond to states of the process generating the time series and can not be interpreted meaningfully . we propose a new method for meaningful unsupervised discretization of numeric time series called persist . the algorithm is based on the kullback-leibler divergence between the marginal and the self-transition probability distributions of the discretization symbols . its performance is evaluated on both artificial and real life data in comparison to the most common discretization methods . persist achieves significantly higher accuracy than existing static methods and is robust against noise . it also outperforms hidden markov models for all but very simple cases .

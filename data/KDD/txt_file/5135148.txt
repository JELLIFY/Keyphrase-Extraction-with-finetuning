web object indexing using domain knowledge a web object is defined to represent any meaningful object embedded in web pages ( e.g. images , music ) or pointed to by hyperlinks ( e.g. downloadable files ) . in many cases , users would like to search for information of a certain ` object ' , rather than a web page containing the query terms . to facilitate web object searching and organizing , in this paper , we propose a novel approach to web object indexing , by discovering its inherent structure information with existed domain knowledge . in our approach , first , layered lsi spaces are built for a better representation of the hierarchically structured domain knowledge , in order to emphasize the specific semantics and term space in each layer of the domain knowledge . meanwhile , the web object representation is constructed by hyperlink analysis , and further pruned to remove the noises . then an optimal matching between the web object and the domain knowledge is performed , in order to pick out the structure attributes of the web object from the knowledge . finally , the obtained structure attributes are used to re-organize and index the web objects . our approach also indicates a new promising way to use trust-worthy deep web knowledge to help organize dispersive information of surface web .

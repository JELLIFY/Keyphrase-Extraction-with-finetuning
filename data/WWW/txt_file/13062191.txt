improving recommendation for long-tail queries via templates the ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of users allows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance features such as query recommendation , correction , etc. . yet , no matter how much data is aggregated , the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare . as a result , most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tail queries . we propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques ( and in particular query recommendation ) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules between query templates rather than individual query transitions , as currently done in query-flow graph models . as a simple example , if we recognize that ` montezuma ' is a city in the rare query `` montezuma surf '' and if the rule ` city surf â†’ beach has been observed , we are able to offer `` montezuma beach '' as a recommendation , even if the two queries were never observed in a same session . we conducted experiments to validate our hypothesis , first via traditional small-scale editorial assessments but more interestingly via a novel automated large scale evaluation methodology . our experiments show that general coverage can be relatively increased by 24 % using templates without penalizing quality . furthermore , for 36 % of the 95m queries in our query flow graph , which have no out edges and thus could not be served recommendations , we can now offer at least one recommendation in 98 % of the cases .

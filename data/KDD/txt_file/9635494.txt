meme-tracking and the dynamics of the news cycle tracking new topics , ideas , and `` memes '' across the web has been an issue of considerable interest . recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales , as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities . however , these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events . we develop a framework for tracking short , distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text ; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases , we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis . as our principal domain of study , we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis . we tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle . in particular , we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively , with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a `` heartbeat '' - like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs . we also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits .

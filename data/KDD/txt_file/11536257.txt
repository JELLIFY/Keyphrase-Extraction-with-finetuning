grafting-light : fast , incremental feature selection and structure learning of markov random fields feature selection is an important task in order to achieve better generalizability in high dimensional learning , and structure learning of markov random fields ( mrfs ) can automatically discover the inherent structures underlying complex data . both problems can be cast as solving an l1-norm regularized parameter estimation problem . the existing grafting method can avoid doing inference on dense graphs in structure learning by incrementally selecting new features . however , grafting performs a greedy step to optimize over free parameters once new features are included . this greedy strategy results in low efficiency when parameter learning is itself non-trivial , such as in mrfs , in which parameter learning depends on an expensive subroutine to calculate gradients . the complexity of calculating gradients in mrfs is typically exponential to the size of maximal cliques . in this paper , we present a fast algorithm called grafting-light to solve the l1-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimation of mrfs for efficient feature selection and structure learning . grafting-light iteratively performs one-step of orthant-wise gradient descent over free parameters and selects new features . this lazy strategy is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum and can effectively select significant features . on both synthetic and real data sets , we show that grafting-light is much more efficient than grafting for both feature selection and structure learning , and performs comparably with the optimal batch method that directly optimizes over all the features for feature selection but is much more efficient and accurate for structure learning of mrfs .

a semantic approach for designing business protocols business processes involve interactions among autonomous partners . we propose that these interactions be specified modularly as protocols . protocols can be published , enabling implementors to independently develop components that respect published protocols and yet serve diverse interests . a variety of business protocols would be needed to capture subtle business needs . we propose that the same kinds of conceptual abstractions be developed for protocols as for information models . specifically , we consider ( 1 ) refinement : a subprotocol may satisfy the requirements of a superprotocol , but support additional properties and ( 2 ) aggregation : a protocol may combine existing protocols . in support of the above , we develop a formal semantics for protocols , an operational characterization of them , and an algebra for protocol composition .

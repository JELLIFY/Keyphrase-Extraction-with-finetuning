accelerated focused crawling through online relevance feedback the organization of html into a tag tree structure , which is rendered by browsers as roughly rectangular regions with embedded text and href links , greatly helps surfers locate and click on links that best satisfy their information need . can an automatic program emulate this human behavior and thereby learn to predict the relevance of an unseen href target page w.r.t. an information need , based on information limited to the href source page ? such a capability would be of great interest in focused crawling and resource discovery , because it can fine-tune the priority of unvisited urls in the crawl frontier , and reduce the number of irrelevant pages which are fetched and discarded .

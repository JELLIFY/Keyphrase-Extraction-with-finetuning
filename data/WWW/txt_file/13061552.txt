finding influential mediators in social networks given a social network , who are the key players controlling the bottlenecks of influence propagation if some persons would like to activate specific individuals ? in this paper , we tackle the problem of selecting a set of k mediator nodes as the influential gateways whose existence determines the activation probabilities of targeted nodes from some given seed nodes . we formally define the k-mediators problem . to have an effective and efficient solution , we propose a three-step greedy method by considering the probabilistic influence and the structural connectivity on the pathways from sources to targets . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to consider the k-mediators problem in networks . experiments on the dblp co-authorship graph show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method .

an adaptive crawler for locating hidden-web entry points in this paper we describe new adaptive crawling strategies to efficiently locate the entry points to hidden-web sources . the fact that hidden-web sources are very sparsely distributedmakes the problem of locating them especially challenging . we deal with this problem by using the contents ofpages to focus the crawl on a topic ; by prioritizing promisinglinks within the topic ; and by also following links that may not lead to immediate benefit . we propose a new frameworkwhereby crawlers automatically learn patterns of promisinglinks and adapt their focus as the crawl progresses , thus greatly reducing the amount of required manual setup andtuning . our experiments over real web pages in a representativeset of domains indicate that online learning leadsto significant gains in harvest rates ' the adaptive crawlers retrieve up to three times as many forms as crawlers thatuse a fixed focus strategy .

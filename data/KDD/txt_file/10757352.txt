data mining to predict and prevent errors in health insurance claims processing health insurance costs across the world have increased alarmingly in recent years . a major cause of this increase are payment errors made by the insurance companies while processing claims . these errors often result in extra administrative effort to re-process ( or rework ) the claim which accounts for up to 30 % of the administrative staff in a typical health insurer . we describe a system that helps reduce these errors using machine learning techniques by predicting claims that will need to be reworked , generating explanations to help the auditors correct these claims , and experiment with feature selection , concept drift , and active learning to collect feedback from the auditors to improve over time . we describe our framework , problem formulation , evaluation metrics , and experimental results on claims data from a large us health insurer . we show that our system results in an order of magnitude better precision ( hit rate ) over existing approaches which is accurate enough to potentially result in over $ 15-25 million in savings for a typical insurer . we also describe interesting research problems in this domain as well as design choices made to make the system easily deployable across health insurance companies .

wand : a meta-data maintenance system over the internet wand is a meta-data management system that provides a file-system tree for users of an internet based p2p network . the tree is robust and retains its structure even when nodes ( peers ) enter and leave the network . the robustness is based on a concept of virtual folders that are automatically created to retain paths to lower level folders whenever a node hosting a higher-level folder moves away . other contributions of the wand system include its novel approach towards managing root directory information and handling network partitions .

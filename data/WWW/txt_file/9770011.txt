anycast-aware transport for content delivery networks anycast-based content delivery networks ( cdns ) have many properties that make them ideal for the large scale distribution of content on the internet . however , because routing changes can result in a change of the endpoint that terminates the tcp session , tcp session disruption remains a concern for anycast cdns , especially for large file downloads . in this paper we demonstrate that this problem does not require any complex solutions . in particular , we present the design of a simple , yet efficient , mechanism to handle session disruptions due to endpoint changes . with our mechanism , a client can continue the download of the content from the point at which it was before the endpoint change . furthermore , cdn servers purge the tcp connection state quickly to handle frequent switching with low system overhead . we demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism and show that more complex mechanisms are not required . specifically , we find that our mechanism maintains high download throughput even with a reasonably high rate of endpoint switching , which is attractive for load balancing scenarios . moreover , our results show that edge servers can purge tcp connection state after a single timeout-triggered retransmission without any tangible impact on ongoing connections . besides improving server performance , this behavior improves the resiliency of the cdn to certain denial of service attacks .

a multiple tree algorithm for the efficient association of asteroid observations in this paper we examine the problem of efficiently finding sets of observations that conform to a given underlying motion model . while this problem is often phrased as a tracking problem , where it is called track initiation , it is useful in a variety of tasks where we want to find correspondences or patterns in spatial-temporal data . unfortunately , this problem often suffers from a combinatorial explosion in the number of potential sets that must be evaluated . we consider the problem with respect to large-scale asteroid observation data , where the goal is to find associations among the observations that correspond to the same underlying asteroid . in this domain , it is vital that we can efficiently extract the underlying associations . we introduce a new methodology for track initiation that exhaustively considers all possible linkages . we then introduce an exact tree-based algorithm for tractably finding all compatible sets of points . further , we extend this approach to use multiple trees , exploiting structure from several time steps at once . we compare this approach to a standard sequential approach and show how the use of multiple trees can provide a significant benefit .

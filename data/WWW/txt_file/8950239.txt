design and implementation of a feedback controller for slowdown differentiation on internet servers proportional slowdown differentiation ( psd ) aims to maintain slowdown ratios between different classes of clients according to their pre-specified differentiation parameters . in this paper , we design a feedback controller to allocate processing rate on internet servers for psd . in this approach , the processing rate of a class is adjusted by an integral feedback controller according to the difference between the target slowdown ratio and the achieved one . the initial rate class is estimated based on predicted workload using queueing theory . we implement the feedback controller in an apache web server . the experimental results under various environments demonstrate the controller 's effectiveness and robustness .

data summaries for on-demand queries over linked data typical approaches for querying structured web data collect ( crawl ) and pre-process ( index ) large amounts of data in a central data repository before allowing for query answering . however , this time-consuming pre-processing phase however leverages the benefits of linked data -- where structured data is accessible live and up-to-date at distributed web resources that may change constantly -- only to a limited degree , as query results can never be current . an ideal query answering system for linked data should return current answers in a reasonable amount of time , even on corpora as large as the web . query processors evaluating queries directly on the live sources require knowledge of the contents of data sources . in this paper , we develop and evaluate an approximate index structure summarising graph-structured content of sources adhering to linked data principles , provide an algorithm for answering conjunctive queries over linked data on theweb exploiting the source summary , and evaluate the system using synthetically generated queries . the experimental results show that our lightweight index structure enables complete and up-to-date query results over linked data , while keeping the overhead for querying low and providing a satisfying source ranking at no additional cost .

building reactive web applications the adaptive web is a new research area addressing the personalization of the web experience for each user . in this paper we propose a new high-level model for the specification of web applications that take into account the manner users interact with the application for supplying appropriate contents or gathering profile data . we therefore consider entire processes ( rather than single properties ) as smallest information units , allowing for automatic restructuring of application components . for this purpose , a high-level event-condition-action ( eca ) paradigm is proposed , which enables capturing arbitrary ( and timed ) clicking behaviors .

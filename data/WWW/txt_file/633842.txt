exception handling in workflow-driven web applications as the web becomes a platform for implementing b2b applications , the need arises of web conceptual models for describing web oriented workflow applications implementing business processes . in this context , new problems about process correctness arise , due to the loose control of web applications upon the behavior of their web clients . indeed , incoherent user 's behavior can lead to inconsistent processes . this paper presents a high level approach to the management of exceptions that occur during the execution of processes on the web . we present a classification of exceptions that can be raised inside workflow-driven web applications , and recovery policies to retrieve coherent status and data after an exception . we devise these concepts at high level and then we exploit them using a web modeling language ( webml ) that in turn provides development facilities like automatic code generation , validation of hypertext models , and so on . an industrial implementation experience is briefly presented too .

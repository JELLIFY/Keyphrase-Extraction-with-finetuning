adaptive web sites : user studies and simulation adaptive web sites have been proposed to enhance ease of navigation and information retrieval . a variety of approaches are described in the literature , but consideration of interface presentation issues and realistic user studies are generally lacking . we report here a large-scale study of sites with dynamic information collections and user interests , where adaptation is based on an ant colony optimization technique . we find that most users were able to locate information effectively without needing to perform explicit searches . the behavior of users who did search was similar to that on internet search engines . simulations based on site and user models give insight into the adaptive behavior and correspond to observations .

mining uncertain data with probabilistic guarantees data uncertainty is inherent in applications such as sensor monitoring systems , location-based services , and biological databases . to manage this vast amount of imprecise information , probabilistic databases have been recently developed . in this paper , we study the discovery of frequent patterns and association rules from probabilistic data under the possible world semantics . this is technically challenging , since a probabilistic database can have an exponential number of possible worlds . we propose two effcient algorithms , which discover frequent patterns in bottom-up and top-down manners . both algorithms can be easily extended to discover maximal frequent patterns . we also explain how to use these patterns to generate association rules . extensive experiments , using real and synthetic datasets , were conducted to validate the performance of our methods .

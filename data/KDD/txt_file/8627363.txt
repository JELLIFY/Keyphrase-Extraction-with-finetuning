cvs : a correlation-verification based smoothing technique on information retrieval and term clustering as information volume in enterprise systems and in the web grows rapidly , how to accurately retrieve information is an important research area . several corpus based smoothing techniques have been proposed to address the data sparsity and synonym problems faced by information retrieval systems . such smoothing techniques are often unable to discover and utilize the correlations among terms . we propose cvs , a correlation-verification based smoothing method , that considers co-occurrence information in smoothing . strongly correlated terms in a document are identified by their co-occurrence frequencies in the document . to avoid missing correlated terms with low co-occurrence frequencies but specific to the theme of the document , the joint distributions of terms in the document are compared with those in the corpus for statistical significance . a common approach to apply corpus based smoothing techniques to information retrieval is by refining the vector representations of documents . this paper investigates the effects of corpus based smoothing on information retrieval by query expansion using term clusters generated from a term clustering process . the results can also be viewed in light of the effects of smoothing on clustering . empirical studies show that our approach outperforms previous corpus based smoothing techniques . it improves retrieval effectiveness by 14.6 % . the results demonstrate that corpus based smoothing can be used for query expansion by term clustering .

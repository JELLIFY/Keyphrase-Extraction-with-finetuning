a novel clustering-based rss aggregator in recent years , different commercial weblog subscribing systems have been proposed to return stories from users . subscribed feeds . in this paper , we propose a novel clustering-based rss aggregator called as rss clusgator system ( rcs ) for weblog reading . note that an rss feed may have several different topics . a user may only be interested in a subset of these topics . in addition there could be many different stories from multiple rss feeds , which discuss similar topic from different perspectives . a user may be interested in this topic but do not know how to collect all feeds related to this topic . in contrast to many previous works , we cluster all stories in rss feeds into hierarchical structure to better serve the readers . through this way , users can easily find all their interested stories . to make the system current , we propose a flexible time window for incremental clustering . rcs utilizes both link information and content information for efficient clustering . experiments show the effectiveness of rcs .

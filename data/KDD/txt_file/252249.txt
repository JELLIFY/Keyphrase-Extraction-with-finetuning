a generalized framework for mining spatio-temporal patterns in scientific data in this paper , we present a general framework to discover spatial associations and spatio-temporal episodes for scientific datasets . in contrast to previous work in this area , features are modeled as geometric objects rather than points . we define multiple distance metrics that take into account objects ' extent and thus are more robust in capturing the influence of an object on other objects in spatial neighborhood . we have developed algorithms to discover four different types of spatial object interaction ( association ) patterns . we also extend our approach to accommodate temporal information and propose a simple algorithm to derive spatio-temporal episodes . we show that such episodes can be used to reason about critical events . we evaluate our framework on real datasets to demonstrate its efficacy . the datasets originate from two different areas : computational molecular dynamics and computational fluid flow . we present results highlighting the importance of the identified patterns and episodes by using knowledge from the underlying domains . we also show that the proposed algorithms scale linearly with respect to the dataset size .

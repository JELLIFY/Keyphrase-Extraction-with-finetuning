constructing virtual documents for ontology matching on the investigation of linguistic techniques used in ontology matching , we propose a new idea of virtual documents to pursue a cost-effective approach to linguistic matching in this paper . basically , as a collection of weighted words , the virtual document of a uriref declared in an ontology contains not only the local descriptions but also the neighboring information to reflect the intended meaning of the uriref . document similarity can be computed by traditional vector space techniques , and then be used in the similarity-based approaches to ontology matching . in particular , the rdf graph structure is exploited to define the description formulations and the neighboring operations . experimental results show that linguistic matching based on the virtual documents is dominant in average f-measure as compared to other three approaches . it is also demonstrated by our experiments that the virtual documents approach is cost-effective as compared to other linguistic matching approaches .

quantification and semi-supervised classification methods for handling changes in class distribution in realistic settings the prevalence of a class may change after a classifier is induced and this will degrade the performance of the classifier . further complicating this scenario is the fact that labeled data is often scarce and expensive . in this paper we address the problem where the class distribution changes and only unlabeled examples are available from the new distribution . we design and evaluate a number of methods for coping with this problem and compare the performance of these methods . our quantification-based methods estimate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from the changed distribution and adjust the original classifier accordingly , while our semi-supervised methods build a new classifier using the examples from the new ( unlabeled ) distribution which are supplemented with predicted class values . we also introduce a hybrid method that utilizes both quantification and semi-supervised learning . all methods are evaluated using accuracy and f-measure on a set of benchmark data sets . our results demonstrate that our methods yield substantial improvements in accuracy and f-measure .

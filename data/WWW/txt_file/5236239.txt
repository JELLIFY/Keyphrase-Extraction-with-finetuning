trust-based recommendation systems : an axiomatic approach high-quality , personalized recommendations are a key feature in many online systems . since these systems often have explicit knowledge of social network structures , the recommendations may incorporate this information . this paper focuses on networks that represent trust and recommendation systems that incorporate these trust relationships . the goal of a trust-based recommendation system is to generate personalized recommendations by aggregating the opinions of other users in the trust network . in analogy to prior work on voting and ranking systems , we use the axiomatic approach from the theory of social choice . we develop a set of five natural axioms that a trust-based recommendation system might be expected to satisfy . then , we show that no system can simultaneously satisfy all the axioms . however , for any subset of four of the five axioms we exhibit a recommendation system that satisfies those axioms . next we consider various ways of weakening the axioms , one of which leads to a unique recommendation system based on random walks . we consider other recommendation systems , including systems based on personalized pagerank , majority of majorities , and minimum cuts , and search for alternative axiomatizations that uniquely characterize these systems . finally , we determine which of these systems are incentive compatible , meaning that groups of agents interested in manipulating recommendations can not induce others to share their opinion by lying about their votes or modifying their trust links . this is an important property for systems deployed in a monetized environment .

mining closed relational graphs with connectivity constraints relational graphs are widely used in modeling large scale networks such as biological networks and social networks . in this kind of graph , connectivity becomes critical in identifying highly associated groups and clusters . in this paper , we investigate the issues of mining closed frequent graphs with connectivity constraints in massive relational graphs where each graph has around 10k nodes and 1m edges . we adopt the concept of edge connectivity and apply the results from graph theory , to speed up the mining process . two approaches are developed to handle different mining requests : closecut , a pattern-growth approach , and splat , a pattern-reduction approach . we have applied these methods in biological datasets and found the discovered patterns interesting .

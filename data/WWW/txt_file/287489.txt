web taxonomy integration using support vector machines we address the problem of integrating objects from a source taxonomy into a master taxonomy . this problem is not only currently pervasive on the web , but also important to the emerging semantic web . a straightforward approach to automating this process would be to train a classifier for each category in the master taxonomy , and then classify objects from the source taxonomy into these categories . in this paper we attempt to use a powerful classification method , support vector machine ( svm ) , to attack this problem . our key insight is that the availability of the source taxonomy data could be helpful to build better classifiers in this scenario , therefore it would be beneficial to do transductive learning rather than inductive learning , i.e. , learning to optimize classification performance on a particular set of test examples . noticing that the categorizations of the master and source taxonomies often have some semantic overlap , we propose a method , cluster shrinkage ( cs ) , to further enhance the classification by exploiting such implicit knowledge . our experiments with real-world web data show substantial improvements in the performance of taxonomy integration .

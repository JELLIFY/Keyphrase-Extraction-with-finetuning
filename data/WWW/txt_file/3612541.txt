web resource geographic location classification and detection rapid pervasion of the web into users ' daily lives has put much importance on capturing location-specific information on the web , due to the fact that most human activities occur locally around where a user is located . this is especially true in the increasingly popular mobile and local search environments . thus , how to correctly and effectively detect locations from web resources has become a key challenge to location-based web applications . in this paper , we first explicitly distinguish the locations of web resources into three types to cater to different application needs : 1 ) provider location ; 2 ) content location ; and 3 ) serving location . then we describe a unified system that computes each of the three locations , employing a set of algorithms and different geographic sources .

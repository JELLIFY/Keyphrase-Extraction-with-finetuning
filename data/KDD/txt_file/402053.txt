online novelty detection on temporal sequences in this paper , we present a new framework for online novelty detection on temporal sequences . this framework include a mechanism for associating each detection result with a confidence value . based on this framework , we develop a concrete online detection algorithm , by modeling the temporal sequence using an online support vector regression algorithm . experiments on both synthetic and real world data are performed to demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed detection algorithm .

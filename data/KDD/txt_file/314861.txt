eliminating noisy information in web pages for data mining a commercial web page typically contains many information blocks . apart from the main content blocks , it usually has such blocks as navigation panels , copyright and privacy notices , and advertisements ( for business purposes and for easy user access ) . we call these blocks that are not the main content blocks of the page the noisy blocks . we show that the information contained in these noisy blocks can seriously harm web data mining . eliminating these noises is thus of great importance . in this paper , we propose a noise elimination technique based on the following observation : in a given web site , noisy blocks usually share some common contents and presentation styles , while the main content blocks of the pages are often diverse in their actual contents and\/or presentation styles . based on this observation , we propose a tree structure , called style tree , to capture the common presentation styles and the actual contents of the pages in a given web site . by sampling the pages of the site , a style tree can be built for the site , which we call the site style tree ( sst ) . we then introduce an information based measure to determine which parts of the sst represent noises and which parts represent the main contents of the site . the sst is employed to detect and eliminate noises in any web page of the site by mapping this page to the sst . the proposed technique is evaluated with two data mining tasks , web page clustering and classification . experimental results show that our noise elimination technique is able to improve the mining results significantly .

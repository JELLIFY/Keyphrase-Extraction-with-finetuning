critical event prediction for proactive management in large-scale computer clusters as the complexity of distributed computing systems increases , systems management tasks require significantly higher levels of automation ; examples include diagnosis and prediction based on real-time streams of computer events , setting alarms , and performing continuous monitoring . the core of autonomic computing , a recently proposed initiative towards next-generation it-systems capable of ` self-healing ' , is the ability to analyze data in real-time and to predict potential problems . the goal is to avoid catastrophic failures through prompt execution of remedial actions . this paper describes an attempt to build a proactive prediction and control system for large clusters . we collected event logs containing various system reliability , availability and serviceability ( ras ) events , and system activity reports ( sars ) from a 350-node cluster system for a period of one year . the ` raw ' system health measurements contain a great deal of redundant event data , which is either repetitive in nature or misaligned with respect to time . we applied a filtering technique and modeled the data into a set of primary and derived variables . these variables used probabilistic networks for establishing event correlations through prediction algorithms . we also evaluated the role of time-series methods , rule-based classification algorithms and bayesian network models in event prediction . based on historical data , our results suggest that it is feasible to predict system performance parameters ( sars ) with a high degree of accuracy using time-series models . rule-based classification techniques can be used to extract machine-event signatures to predict critical events with up to 70 % accuracy .

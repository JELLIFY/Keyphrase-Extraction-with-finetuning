deducing trip related information from flickr uploading tourist photos is a popular activity on photo sharing platforms . these photographs and their associated metadata ( tags , geo-tags , and temporal information ) should be useful for mining information about the sites visited . however , user-supplied metadata are often noisy and efficient filtering methods are needed before extracting useful knowledge . we focus here on exploiting temporal information , associated with tourist sites that appear in flickr . from automatically filtered sets of geo-tagged photos , we deduce answers to questions like `` how long does it take to visit a tourist attraction ? '' or `` what can i visit in one day in this city ? '' our method is evaluated and validated by comparing the automatically obtained visit duration times to manual estimations .

law-governed peer-to-peer auctions this paper proposes a flexible architecture for the creation of internet auctions . it allows the custom definition of the auction parameters , and provides a decentralized control of the auction process . auction policies are defined as laws in the law governed interaction ( lgi ) paradigm . each of these laws specifies not only the auction algorithm itself ( e.g. open-cry , dutch , etc. ) but also how to handle the other parameters usually involved in the online auctions , such as certification , auditioning , and treatment of complaints . lgi is used to enforce the rules established in the auction policy within the agents involved in the process . after the agents find out about the actions , they interact in a peer-to-peer communication protocol , reducing the role of the centralized auction room to an advertising registry , and taking profit of the distributed nature of the internet to conduct the auction . the paper presents an example of an auction law , illustrating the use of the proposed architecture .

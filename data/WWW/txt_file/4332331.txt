detectives : detecting coalition hit inflation attacks in advertising networks streams click fraud is jeopardizing the industry of internet advertising . internet advertising is crucial for the thriving of the entire internet , since it allows producers to advertise their products , and hence contributes to the well being of e-commerce . moreover , advertising supports the intellectual value of the internet by covering the running expenses of publishing content . some content publishers are dishonest , and use automation to generate traffic to defraud the advertisers . similarly , some advertisers automate clicks on the advertisements of their competitors to deplete their competitors ' advertising budgets . this paper describes the advertising network model , and focuses on the most sophisticated type of fraud , which involves coalitions among fraudsters . we build on several published theoretical results to devise the similarity-seeker algorithm that discovers coalitions made by pairs of fraudsters . we then generalize the solution to coalitions of arbitrary sizes . before deploying our system on a real network , we conducted comprehensive experiments on data samples for proof of concept . the results were very accurate . we detected several coalitions , formed using various techniques , and spanning numerous sites . this reveals the generality of our model and approach .

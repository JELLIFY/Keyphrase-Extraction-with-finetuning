on revenue in the generalized second price auction the generalized second price ( gsp ) auction is the primary auction used for selling sponsored search advertisements . in this paper we consider the revenue of this auction at equilibrium . we prove that if agent values are drawn from identical regular distributions , then the gsp auction paired with an appropriate reserve price generates a constant fraction ( 1\/6th ) of the optimal revenue . in the full-information game , we show that at any nash equilibrium of the gsp auction obtains at least half of the revenue of the vcg mechanism excluding the payment of a single participant . this bound holds also with any reserve price , and is tight . finally , we consider the tradeoff between maximizing revenue and social welfare . we introduce a natural convexity assumption on the click-through rates and show that it implies that the revenue-maximizing equilibrium of gsp in the full information model will necessarily be envy-free . in particular , it is always possible to maximize revenue and social welfare simultaneously when click-through rates are convex . without this convexity assumption , however , we demonstrate that revenue may be maximized at a non-envy-free equilibrium that generates a socially inefficient allocation .

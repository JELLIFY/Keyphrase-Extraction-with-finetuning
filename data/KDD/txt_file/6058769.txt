joint latent topic models for text and citations in this work , we address the problem of joint modeling of text and citations in the topic modeling framework . we present two different models called the pairwise-link-lda and the link-plsa-lda models . the pairwise-link-lda model combines the ideas of lda ( 4 ) and mixed membership block stochastic models ( 1 ) and allows modeling arbitrary link structure . however , the model is computationally expensive , since it involves modeling the presence or absence of a citation ( link ) between every pair of documents . the second model solves this problem by assuming that the link structure is a bipartite graph . as the name indicates , link-plsa-lda model combines the lda and plsa models into a single graphical model . our experiments on a subset of citeseer data show that both these models are able to predict unseen data better than the baseline model of erosheva and lafferty ( 8 ) , by capturing the notion of topical similarity between the contents of the cited and citing documents . our experiments on two different data sets on the link prediction task show that the link-plsa-lda model performs the best on the citation prediction task , while also remaining highly scalable . in addition , we also present some interesting visualizations generated by each of the models .

predictive ranking : a novel page ranking approach by estimating the web structure pagerank ( pr ) is one of the most popular ways to rank web pages . however , as the web continues to grow in volume , it is becoming more and more difficult to crawl all the available pages . as a result , the page ranks computed by pr are only based on a subset of the whole web . this produces inaccurate outcome because of the inherent incomplete information ( dangling pages ) that exist in the calculation . to overcome this incompleteness , we propose a new variant of the pagerank algorithm called , predictive ranking ( prer ) , in which different classes of dangling pages are analyzed individually so that the link structure can be predicted more accurately . we detail our proposed steps . furthermore , experimental results show that this algorithm achieves encouraging results when compared with previous methods .

characterizing search intent diversity into click models modeling a user 's click-through behavior in click logs is a challenging task due to the well-known position bias problem . recent advances in click models have adopted the examination hypothesis which distinguishes document relevance from position bias . in this paper , we revisit the examination hypothesis and observe that user clicks can not be completely explained by relevance and position bias . specifically , users with different search intents may submit the same query to the search engine but expect different search results . thus , there might be a bias between user search intent and the query formulated by the user , which can lead to the diversity in user clicks . this bias has not been considered in previous works such as ubm , dbn and ccm . in this paper , we propose a new intent hypothesis as a complement to the examination hypothesis . this hypothesis is used to characterize the bias between the user search intent and the query in each search session . this hypothesis is very general and can be applied to most of the existing click models to improve their capacities in learning unbiased relevance . experimental results demonstrate that after adopting the intent hypothesis , click models can better interpret user clicks and achieve a significant ndcg improvement .

local decomposition for rare class analysis given its importance , the problem of predicting rare classes in large-scale multi-labeled data sets has attracted great attentions in the literature . however , the rare-class problem remains a critical challenge , because there is no natural way developed for handling imbalanced class distributions . this paper thus fills this crucial void by developing a method for classification using local clustering ( cog ) . specifically , for a data set with an imbalanced class distribution , we perform clustering within each large class and produce sub-classes with relatively balanced sizes . then , we apply traditional supervised learning algorithms , such as support vector machines ( svms ) , for classification . indeed , our experimental results on various real-world data sets show that our method produces significantly higher prediction accuracies on rare classes than state-of-the-art methods . furthermore , we show that cog can also improve the performance of traditional supervised learning algorithms on data sets with balanced class distributions .

xj : integration of xml processing into java the increased importance of xml as a universal data representation format has led to several proposals for enabling the development of applications that operate on xml data . these proposals range from runtime api-based interfaces to xml-based programming languages . the subject of this paper is xj , a research language that proposes novel mechanisms for the integration of xml as a first-class construct into javatm . the design goals of xj distinguish it from pastwork on integrating xml support into programming languages -- specifically , the xj design adheres to the xml schema and xpathstandards , and supports in-place updates of xml data thereby keeping with the imperative nature of java . we have also built a prototype compiler for xj , and our preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the performance of xj programs can approach that of tradition allow level api-based interfaces , while providing a higher level of abstraction .

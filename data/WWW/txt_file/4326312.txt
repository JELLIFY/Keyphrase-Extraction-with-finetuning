web log mining with adaptive support thresholds with the fast increase in web activities , web data mining has recently become an important research topic . however , most previous studies of mining path traversal patterns are based on the model of a uniform support threshold without taking into consideration such important factors as the length of a pattern , the positions of web pages , and the importance of a particular pattern , etc. . in view of this , we study and apply the markov chain model to provide the determination of support threshold of web documents . furthermore , by properly employing some techniques devised for joining reference sequences , a new mining procedure of web traversal patterns is proposed in this paper .

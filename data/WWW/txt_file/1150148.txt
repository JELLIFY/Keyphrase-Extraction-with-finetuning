cs aktive space : representing computer science in the semantic web we present a semantic web application that we callcs aktive space . the application exploits a wide range of semantically heterogeneousand distributed content relating to computer science research in theuk . this content is gathered on a continuous basis using a variety of methods including harvesting and scraping as well as adopting a range models for content acquisition . the content currently comprises aroundten million rdf triples and we have developed storage , retrieval andmaintenance methods to support its management . the content is mediated through an ontology constructed for the application domainand incorporates components from other published ontologies . cs aktive spacesupports the exploration of patterns and implications inherent in the content and exploits a variety of visualisations and multi dimensional representations . knowledge services supported in the applicationinclude investigating communities of practice : who is working , researching or publishing with whom . this work illustrates a number ofsubstantial challenges for the semantic web . these include problems of referential integrity , tractable inference and interaction support . wereview our approaches to these issues and discuss relevant related work .

topic initiator detection on the world wide web in this paper we introduce a new web mining and search technique - topic initiator detection ( tid ) on the web . given a topic query on the internet and the resulting collection of time-stamped web documents which contain the query keywords , the task of tid is to automatically return which web document ( or its author ) initiated the topic or was the first to discuss about the topic . to deal with the tid problem , we design a system framework and propose algorithm initrank ( initiator ranking ) to rank the web documents by their possibility to be the topic initiator . we first extract features from the web documents and design several topic initiator indicators . then , we propose a tcl graph which integrates the time , content and link information and design an optimization framework over the graph to compute initrank . experiments show that compared with baseline methods , such as direct time sorting , well-known link based ranking algorithms pagerank and hits , initrank achieves the best overall performance with high effectiveness and robustness . in case studies , we successfully detected ( 1 ) the first web document related to a famous rumor of an australia product banned in usa and ( 2 ) the pre-release of ibm and google cloud computing collaboration before the official announcement .

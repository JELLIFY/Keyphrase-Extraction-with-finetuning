towards extracting flickr tag semantics we address the problem of extracting semantics of tags -- short , unstructured text-labels assigned to resources on the web -- based on each tag 's metadata patterns . in particular , we describe an approach for extracting place and event semantics for tags that are assigned to photos on flickr , a popular photo sharing website supporting time and location ( latitude\/longitude ) metadata . the approach can be generalized to other domains where text terms can be extracted and associated with metadata patterns , such as geo-annotated web pages .

adapting databases and webdav protocol the ability of the web to share data regardless of geographical location raises a new issue called remote authoring . with the internet and web browsers being independent of hardware , it becomes possible to build web-enabled database applications . many approaches are provided to integrate databases into the web environment , which use the web 's protocol i.e. http to transfer the data between clients and servers . however , those methods are affected by the http shortfalls with regard to remote authoring . this paper introduces and discusses a new methodology for remote authoring of databases , which is based on the webdav protocol . it is a seamless and effective methodology for accessing and authoring databases , particularly in that it naturally benefits from the webdav advantages such as metadata and access control . these features establish a standard way of accessing database metadata , and increase the database security , while speeding up the database connection .

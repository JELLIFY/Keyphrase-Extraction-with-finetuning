extrapolation methods for accelerating pagerank computations we present a novel algorithm for the fast computation of pagerank , a hyperlink-based estimate of the '' importance '' of web pages . the original pagerank algorithm uses the power method to compute successive iterates that converge to the principal eigenvector of the markov matrix representing the web link graph . the algorithm presented here , called quadratic extrapolation , accelerates the convergence of the power method by periodically subtracting off estimates of the nonprincipal eigenvectors from the current iterate of the power method . in quadratic extrapolation , we take advantage of the fact that the first eigenvalue of a markov matrix is known to be 1 to compute the nonprincipal eigenvectors using successive iterates of the power method . empirically , we show that using quadratic extrapolation speeds up pagerank computation by 25-300 % on a web graph of 80 million nodes , with minimal overhead . our contribution is useful to the pagerank community and the numerical linear algebra community in general , as it is a fast method for determining the dominant eigenvector of a matrix that is too large for standard fast methods to be practical .

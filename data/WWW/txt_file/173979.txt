probabilistic question answering on the web web-based search engines such as google and northernlight return documents that are relevant to a user query , not answers to user questions . we have developed an architecture that augments existing search engines so that they support natural language question answering . the process entails five steps : query modulation , document retrieval , passage extraction , phrase extraction , and answer ranking . in this paper we describe some probabilistic approaches to the last three of these stages . we show how our techniques apply to a number of existing search engines and we also present results contrasting three different methods for question answering . our algorithm , probabilistic phrase reranking ( ppr ) using proximity and question type features achieves a total reciprocal document rank of .20 on the trec 8 corpus . our techniques have been implemented as a web-accessible system , called nsir .

geographical topic discovery and comparison this paper studies the problem of discovering and comparing geographical topics from gps-associated documents . gps-associated documents become popular with the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies . for example , in flickr , the geo-tagged photos are associated with tags and gps locations . in twitter , the locations of the tweets can be identified by the gps locations from smart phones . many interesting concepts , including cultures , scenes , and product sales , correspond to specialized geographical distributions . in this paper , we are interested in two questions : ( 1 ) how to discover different topics of interests that are coherent in geographical regions ? ( 2 ) how to compare several topics across different geographical locations ? to answer these questions , this paper proposes and compares three ways of modeling geographical topics : location-driven model , text-driven model , and a novel joint model called lgta ( latent geographical topic analysis ) that combines location and text . to make a fair comparison , we collect several representative datasets from flickr website including landscape , activity , manhattan , national park , festival , car , and food . the results show that the first two methods work in some datasets but fail in others . lgta works well in all these datasets at not only finding regions of interests but also providing effective comparisons of the topics across different locations . the results confirm our hypothesis that the geographical distributions can help modeling topics , while topics provide important cues to group different geographical regions .

semi-supervised time series classification the problem of time series classification has attracted great interest in the last decade . however current research assumes the existence of large amounts of labeled training data . in reality , such data may be very difficult or expensive to obtain . for example , it may require the time and expertise of cardiologists , space launch technicians , or other domain specialists . as in many other domains , there are often copious amounts of unlabeled data available . for example , the physiobank archive contains gigabytes of ecg data . in this work we propose a semi-supervised technique for building time series classifiers . while such algorithms are well known in text domains , we will show that special considerations must be made to make them both efficient and effective for the time series domain . we evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse data sources including electrocardiograms , handwritten documents , and video datasets . the experimental results demonstrate that our approach requires only a handful of labeled examples to construct accurate classifiers .

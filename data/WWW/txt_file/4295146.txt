xvm : a bridge between xml data and its behavior xml has become one of the core technologies for contemporary business applications , especially web-based applications . to facilitate processing of diverse xml data , we propose an extensible , integrated xml processing architecture , the xml virtual machine ( xvm ) , which connects xml data with their behaviors . at the same time , the xvm is also a framework for developing and deploying xml-based applications . using component-based techniques , the xvm supports arbitrary granularity and provides a high degree of modularity and reusability . xvm components are dynamically loaded and composed during xml data processing . using the xvm , both client-side and server-side xml applications can be developed and deployed in an integrated way . we also present an xml application container built on top of the xvm along with several sample applications to demonstrate the applicability of the xvm framework .

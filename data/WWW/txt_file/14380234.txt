learning from the past : answering new questions with past answers community-based question answering sites , such as yahoo ! answers or baidu zhidao , allow users to get answers to complex , detailed and personal questions from other users . however , since answering a question depends on the ability and willingness of users to address the asker 's needs , a significant fraction of the questions remain unanswered . we measured that in yahoo ! answers , this fraction represents 15 % of all incoming english questions . at the same time , we discovered that around 25 % of questions in certain categories are recurrent , at least at the question-title level , over a period of one year . we attempt to reduce the rate of unanswered questions in yahoo ! answers by reusing the large repository of past resolved questions , openly available on the site . more specifically , we estimate the probability whether certain new questions can be satisfactorily answered by a best answer from the past , using a statistical model specifically trained for this task . we leverage concepts and methods from query-performance prediction and natural language processing in order to extract a wide range of features for our model . the key challenge here is to achieve a level of quality similar to the one provided by the best human answerers . we evaluated our algorithm on offline data extracted from yahoo ! answers , but more interestingly , also on online data by using three `` live '' answering robots that automatically provide past answers to new questions when a certain degree of confidence is reached . we report the success rate of these robots in three active yahoo ! answers categories in terms of both accuracy , coverage and askers ' satisfaction . this work presents a first attempt , to the best of our knowledge , of automatic question answering to questions of social nature , by reusing past answers of high quality .

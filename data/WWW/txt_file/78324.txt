newsjunkie : providing personalized newsfeeds via analysis of information novelty we present a principled methodology for filtering news stories by formal measures of information novelty , and show how the techniques can be usedto custom-tailor news feeds based on information that a user has already reviewed . we review methods for analyzing novelty and then describe newsjunkie , a system that personalizes news for users by identifying the novelty of stories in the context of stories they have already reviewed . newsjunkie employs novelty-analysis algorithms that represent articles as words and named entities . the algorithms analyze inter-andintra-document dynamics by considering how information evolves over timefrom article to article , as well as within individual articles . we review the results of a user study undertaken to gauge the value of the approachover legacy time-based review of newsfeeds , and also to compare the performance of alternate distance metrics that are used to estimate the dissimilarity between candidate new articles and sets of previously reviewed articles .

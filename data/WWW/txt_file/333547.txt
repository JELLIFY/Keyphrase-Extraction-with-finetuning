analysis of topic dynamics in web search we report on a study of topic dynamics for pages visited by a sample of people using msn search . we examine the predictive accuracies of probabilistic models of topic transitions for individuals and groups of users . we explore temporal dynamics by comparing the accuracy of the models for predicting topic transitions at increasingly distant times in the future . finally , we discuss directions for applying models of search topic dynamics .

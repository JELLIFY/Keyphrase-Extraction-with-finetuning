towards context-aware adaptable web services in this paper , we present a context framework that facilitates the development and deployment of context-aware adaptable web services . web services are provided with context information about clients that may be utilized to provide a personalized behavior . context is extensible with new types of information at any time without any changes to the underlying infrastructure . context processing is done by web services , context plugins , or context services . context plugins and context services pre - and post-process web service messages based on the available contextinformation . both are essential for automatic context processing and automatic adaption of web services to new context types without the necessity to adjust the web services themselves . we implemented the context framework within the serviceglobe system , our open and distributed web service platform .

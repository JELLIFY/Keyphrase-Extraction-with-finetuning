rapid development of spreadsheet-based web mashups the rapid growth of social networking sites and web communities have motivated web sites to expose their apis to external developers who create mashups by assembling existing functionalities . current apis , however , aim toward developers with programming expertise ; they are not directly usable by wider class of users who do not have programming background , but would nevertheless like to build their own mashups . to address this need , we propose a spreadsheet-based web mashups development framework , which enables users to develop mashups in the popular spreadsheet environment . first , we provide a mechanism that makes structured data first class values of spreadsheet cells . second , we propose a new component model that can be used to develop fairly sophisticated mashups , involving joining data sources and keeping spreadsheet data up to date . third , to simplify mashup development , we provide a collection of spreadsheet-based mashup patterns that captures common web data access and spreadsheet presentation functionalities . users can reuse and customize these patterns to build spreadsheet-based web mashups instead of developing them from scratch . fourth , we enable users to manipulate structured data presented on spreadsheet in a drag-and-drop fashion . finally , we have developed and tested a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework .

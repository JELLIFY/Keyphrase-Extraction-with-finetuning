privacy-preserving k-means clustering over vertically partitioned data privacy and security concerns can prevent sharing of data , derailing data mining projects . distributed knowledge discovery , if done correctly , can alleviate this problem . the key is to obtain valid results , while providing guarantees on the ( non ) disclosure of data . we present a method for k-means clustering when different sites contain different attributes for a common set of entities . each site learns the cluster of each entity , but learns nothing about the attributes at other sites .

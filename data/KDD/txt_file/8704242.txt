efficient elastic burst detection in data streams burst detection is the activity of finding abnormal aggregates in data streams . such aggregates are based on sliding windows over data streams . in some applications , we want to monitor many sliding window sizes simultaneously and to report those windows with aggregates significantly different from other periods . we will present a general data structure for detecting interesting aggregates over such elastic windows in near linear time . we present applications of the algorithm for detecting gamma ray bursts in large-scale astrophysical data . detection of periods with high volumes of trading activities and high stock price volatility is also demonstrated using real time trade and quote ( taq ) data from the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) . our algorithm beats the direct computation approach by several orders of magnitude .

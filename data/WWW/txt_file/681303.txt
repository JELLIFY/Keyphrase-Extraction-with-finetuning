scaling link-based similarity search to exploit the similarity information hidden in the hyperlink structure of the web , this paper introduces algorithms scalable to graphs with billions of vertices on a distributed architecture . the similarity of multi-step neighborhoods of vertices are numerically evaluated by similarity functions including simrank ( 20 ) , a recursive refinement of cocitation ; psimrank , a novel variant with better theoretical characteristics ; and the jaccard coefficient , extended to multi-step neighborhoods . our methods are presented in a general framework of monte carlo similarity search algorithms that precompute an index database of random fingerprints , and at query time , similarities are estimated from the fingerprints . the performance and quality of the methods were tested on the stanford webbase ( 19 ) graph of 80m pages by comparing our scores to similarities extracted from the odp directory ( 26 ) . our experimental results suggest that the hyperlink structure of vertices within four to five steps provide more adequate information for similarity search than single-step neighborhoods .

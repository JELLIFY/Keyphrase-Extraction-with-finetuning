clinical and financial outcomes analysis with existing hospital patient records existing patient records are a valuable resource for automated outcomes analysis and knowledge discovery . however , key clinical data in these records is typically recorded in unstructured form as free text and images , and most structured clinical information is poorly organized . time-consuming interpretation and analysis is required to convert these records into structured clinical data . thus , only a tiny fraction of this resource is utilized . we present remind , a bayesian framework for reliable extraction and meaningful inference from nonstructured data . remind integrates and blends the structured and unstructured clinical data in patient records to automatically created high-quality structured clinical data . this structuring allows existing patient records to be mined for quality assurance , regulatory compliance , and to relate financial and clinical factors . we demonstrate remind on two medical applications : ( a ) extract `` recurrence '' , the key outcome for measuring treatment effectiveness , for colon cancer patients ( ii ) extract key diagnoses and complications for acute myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) patients , and demonstrate the impact of these clinical factors on financial outcomes .

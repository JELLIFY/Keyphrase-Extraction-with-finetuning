predicting prostate cancer recurrence via maximizing the concordance index in order to effectively use machine learning algorithms , e.g. , neural networks , for the analysis of survival data , the correct treatment of censored data is crucial . the concordance index ( ci ) is a typical metric for quantifying the predictive ability of a survival model . we propose a new algorithm that directly uses the ci as the objective function to train a model , which predicts whether an event will eventually occur or not . directly optimizing the ci allows the model to make complete use of the information from both censored and non-censored observations . in particular , we approximate the ci via a differentiable function so that gradient-based methods can be used to train the model . we applied the new algorithm to predict the eventual recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy . compared with the traditional cox proportional hazards model and several other algorithms based on neural networks and support vector machines , our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in being able to identify high-risk and low-risk groups of patients .

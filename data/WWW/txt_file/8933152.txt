a scheme of service discovery and control on ubiquitous devices we have developed a set of hardware and software components to realize ubiquitous computing environments , based on two keywords , simple '' ( easy to implement ) and `` open '' ( adopt widely publicized specifications ) . then this set has been resulted into ubkit ( ubiquity building toolkit ) . the micro-server an instance of ubkitenables existing consumer electronics to join in computer networks . in this paperwe propose a scheme for discovery and control of deviecs attached to micro-servers .

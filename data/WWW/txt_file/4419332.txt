an audio\/video analysis mechanism for web indexing the high availability of video streams is making necessary mechanisms for indexing such contents in the web world . in this paper we focus on news programs and we propose a mechanism that integrates low and high level video features to provide a high level semantic description . a color\/luminance analysis is coupled with audio analysis to provide a better identification of all the video segments that compose the video stream . each video segment is subject to speech detection and is described through mpeg7 so that the resulting metadata description can be used to index the video stream . an experimental evaluation shows the benefits of integrating audio and video analysis .

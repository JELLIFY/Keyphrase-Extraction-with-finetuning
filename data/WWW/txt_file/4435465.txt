toward expressive syndication on the web syndication systems on the web have attracted vast amounts of attention in recent years . as technologies have emerged and matured , there has been a transition to more expressive syndication approaches ; that is , subscribers and publishers are provided with more expressive means of describing their interests and published content , enabling more accurate information filtering . in this paper , we formalize a syndication architecture that utilizes expressive web ontologies and logic-based reasoning for selective content dissemination . this provides finer grained control for filtering and automated reasoning for discovering implicit subscription matches , both of which are not achievable in less expressive approaches . we then address one of the main limitations with such a syndication approach , namely matching newly published information with subscription requests in an efficient and practical manner . to this end , we investigate continuous query answering for a large subset of the web ontology language ( owl ) ; specifically , we formally define continuous queries for owl knowledge bases and present a novel algorithm for continuous query answering in a large subset of this language . lastly , an evaluation of the query approach is shown , demonstrating its effectiveness for syndication purposes .

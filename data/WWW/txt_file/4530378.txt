toward tighter integration of web search with a geographic information system integration of web search with geographic information has recently attracted much attention . there are a number of local web search systems enabling users to find location-specific web content . in this paper , however , we point out that this integration is still at a superficial level . most local web search systems today only link local web content to a map interface . they are extensions of a conventional stand-alone geographic information system ( gis ) , applied to a web-based client-server architecture . in this paper , we discuss the directions available for tighter integration of web search with a gis , in terms of extraction , knowledge discovery , and presentation . we also describe implementations to support our argument that the integration must go beyond the simple map-and hyperlink architecture .

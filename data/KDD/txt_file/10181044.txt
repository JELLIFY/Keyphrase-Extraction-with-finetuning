bgp-lens : patterns and anomalies in internet routing updates the border gateway protocol ( bgp ) is one of the fundamental computer communication protocols . monitoring and mining bgp update messages can directly reveal the health and stability of internet routing . here we make two contributions : firstly we find patterns in bgp updates , like self-similarity , power-law and lognormal marginals ; secondly using these patterns , we find anomalies . specifically , we develop bgp-lens , an automated bgp updates analysis tool , that has three desirable properties : ( a ) it is effective , able to identify phenomena that would otherwise go unnoticed , such as a peculiar ` clothesline ' behavior or prolonged ` spikes ' that last as long as 8 hours ; ( b ) it is scalable , using algorithms are all linear on the number of time-ticks ; and ( c ) it is admin-friendly , giving useful leads for phenomenon of interest . we showcase the capabilities of bgp-lens by identifying surprising phenomena verified by syadmins , over a massive trace of bgp updates spanning 2 years , from the publicly available site datapository.net .

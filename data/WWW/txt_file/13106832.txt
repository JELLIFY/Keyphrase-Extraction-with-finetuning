piazza : data management infrastructure for semantic web applications the semantic web envisions a world wide web in which data is described with rich semantics and applications can pose complex queries . to this point , researchers have defined new languages for specifying meanings for concepts and developed techniques for reasoning about them , using rdf as the data model . to flourish , the semantic web needs to be able to accommodate the huge amounts of existing data and the applications operating on them . to achieve this , we are faced with two problems . first , most of the world 's data is available not in rdf but in xml ; xml and the applications consuming it rely not only on the domain structure of the data , but also on its document structure . hence , to provide interoperability between such sources , we must map between both their domain structures and their document structures . second , data management practitioners often prefer to exchange data through local point-to-point data translations , rather than mapping to common mediated schemas or ontologies . this paper describes the piazza system , which addresses these challenges . piazza offers a language for mediating between data sources on the semantic web , which maps both the domain structure and document structure . piazza also enables interoperation of xml data with rdf data that is accompanied by rich owl ontologies . mappings in piazza are provided at a local scale between small sets of nodes , and our query answering algorithm is able to chain sets mappings together to obtain relevant data from across the piazza network . we also describe an implemented scenario in piazza and the lessons we learned from it .

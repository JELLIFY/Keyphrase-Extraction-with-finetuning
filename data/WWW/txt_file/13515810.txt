retaining personal expression for social search web is being extensively used for personal expression , which includes ratings , reviews , recommendations , blogs . this user created content , e.g. book review on amazon.com , becomes the property of the website , and the user often does not have easy access to it . in some cases , user 's feedback may get averaged with feedback from other users e.g. ratings of a video . we argue that the creator of such content needs to be able to retain ( a link to ) her created content . we introduce the concept of meb which is a user controlled store of such retained links . a meb allows a user to access\/share all the reviews she has given on different websites . with this capability users can allow their friends to search through their feedback . searching through one 's social network allows harnessing the power of social networks where known relationships provide the context & trust necessary to interpret feedback .

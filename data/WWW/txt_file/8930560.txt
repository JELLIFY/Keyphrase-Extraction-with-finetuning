efficient web change monitoring with page digest the internet and the world wide web have enabled a publishing explosion of useful online information , which has produced the unfortunate side effect of information overload : it is increasingly difficult for individuals to keep abreast of fresh information . in this paper we describe an approach for building a system for efficiently monitoring changes to web documents . this paper has three main contributions . first , we present a coherent framework that captures different characteristics of web documents . the system uses the page digest encoding to provide a comprehensive monitoring system for content , structure , and other interesting properties of web documents . second , the page digest encoding enables improved performance for individual page monitors through mechanisms such as short-circuit evaluation , linear time algorithms for document and structure similarity , and data size reduction . finally , we develop a collection of sentinel grouping techniques based on the page digest encoding to reduce redundant processing in large-scale monitoring systems by grouping similar monitoring requests together . we examine how effective these techniques are over a wide range of parameters and have seen an order of magnitude speed up over existing web-based information monitoring systems .

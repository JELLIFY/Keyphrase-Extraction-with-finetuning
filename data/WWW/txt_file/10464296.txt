dtwiki : a disconnection and intermittency tolerant wiki wikis have proven to be a valuable tool for collaboration and content generation on the web . simple semantics and ease-of-use make wiki systems well suited for meeting many emerging region needs in the areas of education , collaboration and local content generation . despite their usefulness , current wiki software does not work well in the network environments found in emerging regions . for example , it is common to have long-lasting network partitions due to cost , power and poor connectivity . network partitions make a traditional centralized wiki architecture unusable due to the unavailability of the central server . existing solutions towards addressing connectivity problems include web-caching proxies and snapshot distribution . while proxies and snapshots allow wiki data to be read while disconnected , they prevent users from contributing updates back to the wiki . in this paper we detail the design and implementation of dtwiki , a wiki system which explicitly addresses the problem of operating a wiki system in an intermittent environment . the dtwiki system is able to cope with long-lasting partitions and bad connectivity while providing the functionality of popular wiki software such as mediawiki and twiki .

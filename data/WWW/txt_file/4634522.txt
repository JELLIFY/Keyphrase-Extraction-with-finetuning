flux : fuzzy content and structure matching of xml range queries an xml range query may impose predicates on the numerical or textual contents of the elements and\/or their respective path structures . in order to handle content and structure range queries efficiently , an xml query processing engine needs to incorporate effective indexing and summarization techniques to efficiently partition the xml document and locate the results . in this paper , we propose a dynamic summarization and indexing method , flux , based on bloom filters and b + - trees to tackle these problems . the results of our extensive experimental evaluations indicated the efficiency of the proposed system .

flexible on-device service object replication with replets an increasingly large amount of web applications employ service objects such as servlets to generate dynamic and personalized content . existing caching infrastructures are not well suited for caching such content in mobile environments because of disconnection and weak connection . one possible approach to this problem is to replicate web-related application logic to client devices . the challenges to this approach are to deal with client devices that exhibit huge divergence in resource availabilities , to support applications that have different data sharing and coherency requirements , and to accommodate the same application under different deployment environments . the replet system targets these challenges . it uses client , server and application capability and preference information ( cpi ) to direct the replication of service objects to client devices : from the selection of a device for replication and populating the device with client-specific data , to choosing an appropriate replica to serve a given request and maintaining the desired state consistency among replicas . the replet system exploits on-device replication to enable client - , server - and application-specific cost metrics for replica invocation and synchronization . we have implemented a prototype in the context of servlet-based web applications . our experiment and simulation results demonstrate the viability and significant benefits of cpi-driven on-device service object replication .

identifying enrichment candidates in textbooks many textbooks written in emerging countries lack clear and adequate coverage of important concepts . we propose a technological solution for algorithmically identifying those sections of a book that are not well written and could benefit from better exposition . we provide a decision model based on the syntactic complexity of writing and the dispersion of key concepts . the model parameters are learned using a tune set which is algorithmically generated using a versioned authoritative web resource as a proxy . we evaluate the proposed methodology over a corpus of indian textbooks which demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying enrichment candidates .

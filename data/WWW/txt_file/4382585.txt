generating maps of web pages using cellular automata the aim of web pages visualization is to present in a very informative and interactive way a set of web documents to the user in order to let him or her navigate through these documents . in the web context , this may correspond to several user 's tasks : displaying the results of a search engine , or visualizing a graph of pages such as a hypertext or a surf map . in addition to web pages visualization , web pages clustering also greatly improves the amount of information presented to the user by highlighting the similarities between the documents ( 6 ) . in this paper we explore the use of a cellular automata ( ca ) to generate such maps of web pages .

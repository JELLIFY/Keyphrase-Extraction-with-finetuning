web montage : a dynamic personalized start page despite the connotation of the words `` browsing '' and `` surfing , '' web usage often follows routine patterns of access . however , few mechanisms exist to assist users with these routine tasks ; bookmarks or portal sites must be maintained manually and are insensitive to the user 's browsing context . to fill this void , we designed and implemented the montage system . a web montage is an ensemble of links and content fused into a single view . such a coalesced view can be presented to the user whenever he or she opens the browser or returns to the start page . we pose a number of hypotheses about how users would interact with such a system , and test these hypotheses with a fielded user study . our findings support some design decisions , such as using browsing context to tailor the montage , raise questions about others , and point the way toward future work .

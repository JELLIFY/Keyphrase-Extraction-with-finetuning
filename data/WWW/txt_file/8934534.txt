a hybrid approach for searching in the semantic web this paper presents a search architecture that combines classical search techniques with spread activation techniques applied to a semantic model of a given domain . given an ontology , weights are assigned to links based on certain properties of the ontology , so that they measure the strength of the relation . spread activation techniques are used to find related concepts in the ontology given an initial set of concepts and corresponding initial activation values . these initial values are obtained from the results of classical search applied to the data associated with the concepts in the ontology . two test cases were implemented , with very positive results . it was also observed that the proposed hybrid spread activation , combining the symbolic and the sub-symbolic approaches , achieved better results when compared to each of the approaches alone .

dynamic cost-per-action mechanisms and applications to online advertising we study the cost-per-action or cost-per-acquisition ( cpa ) charging scheme in online advertising . in this scheme , instead of paying per click , the advertisers pay only when a user takes a specific action ( e.g. fills out a form ) or completes a transaction on their websites . we focus on designing efficient and incentive compatible mechanisms that use this charging scheme . we describe a mechanism based on a sampling-based learning algorithm that under suitable assumptions is asymptotically individually rational , asymptotically bayesian incentive compatible and asymptotically ex-ante efficient . in particular , we demonstrate our mechanism for the case where the utility functions of the advertisers are independent and identically-distributed random variables as well as the case where they evolve like independent reflected brownian motions .

assessing data mining results via swap randomization the problem of assessing the significance of data mining results on high-dimensional 0-1 data sets has been studied extensively in the literature . for problems such as mining frequent sets and finding correlations , significance testing can be done by , e.g. , chi-square tests , or many other methods . however , the results of such tests depend only on the specific attributes and not on the dataset as a whole . moreover , the tests are more difficult to apply to sets of patterns or other complex results of data mining . in this paper , we consider a simple randomization technique that deals with this shortcoming . the approach consists of producing random datasets that have the same row and column margins with the given dataset , computing the results of interest on the randomized instances , and comparing them against the results on the actual data . this randomization technique can be used to assess the results of many different types of data mining algorithms , such as frequent sets , clustering , and rankings . to generate random datasets with given margins , we use variations of a markov chain approach , which is based on a simple swap operation . we give theoretical results on the efficiency of different randomization methods , and apply the swap randomization method to several well-known datasets . our results indicate that for some datasets the structure discovered by the data mining algorithms is a random artifact , while for other datasets the discovered structure conveys meaningful information .

imds : intelligent malware detection system the proliferation of malware has presented a serious threat to the security of computer systems . traditional signature-based anti-virus systems fail to detect polymorphic and new , previously unseen malicious executables . in this paper , resting on the analysis of windows api execution sequences called by pe files , we develop the intelligent malware detection system ( imds ) using objective-oriented association ( ooa ) mining based classification . imds is an integrated system consisting of three major modules : pe parser , ooa rule generator , and rule based classifier . an ooa algorithm is adapted to efficiently generate ooa rules for classification . a comprehensive experimental study on a large collection of pe files obtained from the anti-virus laboratory of king-soft corporation is performed to compare various malware detection approaches . promising experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of our imds system out perform popular anti-virus software such as norton antivirus and mcafee virusscan , as well as previous data mining based detection systems which employed naive bayes , support vector machine ( svm ) and decision tree techniques .

time series shapelets : a new primitive for data mining classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade . recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems . while this may be considered good news , given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm , there are some negative consequences of this . first , the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset , resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability , especially on resource-limited sensors . second , beyond mere classification accuracy , we often wish to gain some insight into the data . in this work we introduce a new time series primitive , time series shapelets , which addresses these limitations . informally , shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class . as we shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains , algorithms based on the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable , more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art classifiers .

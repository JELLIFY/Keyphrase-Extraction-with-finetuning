the complexity of mining maximal frequent itemsets and maximal frequent patterns mining maximal frequent itemsets is one of the most fundamental problems in data mining . in this paper we study the complexity-theoretic aspects of maximal frequent itemset mining , from the perspective of counting the number of solutions . we present the first formal proof that the problem of counting the number of distinct maximal frequent itemsets in a database of transactions , given an arbitrary support threshold , is #p - complete , thereby providing strong theoretical evidence that the problem of mining maximal frequent itemsets is np-hard . this result is of particular interest since the associated decision problem of checking the existence of a maximal frequent itemset is in p. we also extend our complexity analysis to other similar data mining problems dealing with complex data structures , such as sequences , trees , and graphs , which have attracted intensive research interests in recent years . normally , in these problems a partial order among frequent patterns can be defined in such a way as to preserve the downward closure property , with maximal frequent patterns being those without any successor with respect to this partial order . we investigate several variants of these mining problems in which the patterns of interest are subsequences , subtrees , or subgraphs , and show that the associated problems of counting the number of maximal frequent patterns are all either #p - complete or #p - hard .

ep-sparql : a unified language for event processing and stream reasoning streams of events appear increasingly today in various web applications such as blogs , feeds , sensor data streams , geospatial information , on-line financial data , etc. . event processing ( ep ) is concerned with timely detection of compound events within streams of simple events . state-of-the-art ep provides on-the-fly analysis of event streams , but can not combine streams with background knowledge and can not perform reasoning tasks . on the other hand , semantic tools can effectively handle background knowledge and perform reasoning thereon , but can not deal with rapidly changing data provided by event streams . to bridge the gap , we propose event processing sparql ( ep-sparql ) as a new language for complex events and stream reasoning . we provide syntax and formal semantics of the language and devise an effective execution model for the proposed formalism . the execution model is grounded on logic programming , and features effective event processing and inferencing capabilities over temporal and static knowledge . we provide an open-source prototype implementation and present a set of tests to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach .

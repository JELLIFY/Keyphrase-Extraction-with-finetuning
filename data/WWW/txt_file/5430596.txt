xml design for relational storage design principles for xml schemas that eliminate redundancies and avoid update anomalies have been studied recently . several normal forms , generalizing those for relational databases , have been proposed . all of them , however , are based on the assumption of anative xml storage , while in practice most of xml data is stored inrelational databases . in this paper we study xml design and normalization for relational storage of xml documents . to be able to relate and compare xml and relational designs , we use an information-theoretic framework that measures information content in relations and documents , with higher values corresponding to lower levels of redundancy . we show that most common relational storage schemes preserve the notion of being well-designed ( i.e. , anomalies - and redundancy-free ) . thus , existing xml normal forms guarantee well-designed relational storagesas well . we further show that if this perfect option is not achievable , then a slight restriction on xml constraints guarantees a `` second-best '' relational design , according to possible values of the information-theoretic measure . we finally consider an edge-based relational representation of xml documents , and show that while it has similar information-theoretic properties with other relational representations , it can behave significantly worse in terms of enforcing integrity constraints .

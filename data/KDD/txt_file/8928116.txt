on interactive visualization of high-dimensional data using the hyperbolic plane we propose a novel projection based visualization method for high-dimensional datasets by combining concepts from mds and the geometry of the hyperbolic spaces . our approach hyperbolic multi-dimensional scaling ( h-mds ) extends earlier work ( 7 ) using hyperbolic spaces for visualization of tree structures data ( `` hyperbolic tree browser '' ) . by borrowing concepts from multi-dimensional scaling we map proximity data directly into the 2-dimensional hyperbolic space ( h2 ) . this removes the restriction to `` quasihierarchical '' , graph-based data -- limiting previous work . since a suitable distance function can convert all kinds of data to proximity ( or distance-based ) data this type of data can be considered the most general . we used the circular poincar√© model of the h2 which allows effective human-computer interaction : by moving the `` focus '' via mouse the user can navigate in the data without loosing the `` context '' . in h2 the `` fish-eye '' behavior originates not simply by a non-linear view transformation but rather by extraordinary , non-euclidean properties of the h2 . especially , the exponential growth of length and area of the underlying space makes the h2 a prime target for mapping hierarchical and ( now also ) high-dimensional data . we present several high-dimensional mapping examples including synthetic and real world data and a successful application for unstructured text . by analyzing and integrating multiple film critiques from news : rec . art . movies . reviews and the internet movie database , each movie becomes placed within the h2 . here the idea is , that related films share more words in their reviews than unrelated . their semantic proximity leads to a closer arrangement . the result is a kind of high-level content structured display allowing the user to explore the `` space of movies '' .

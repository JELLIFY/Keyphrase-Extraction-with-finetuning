a comparative analysis of web and peer-to-peer traffic peer-to-peer ( p2p ) applications continue to grow in popularity , and have reportedly overtaken web applications as the single largest contributor to internet traffic . using traces collected from a large edge network , we conduct an extensive analysis of p2p traffic , compare p2p traffic with web traffic , and discuss the implications of increased p2p traffic . in addition to studying the aggregate p2p traffic , we also analyze and compare the two main constituents of p2p traffic in our data , namely bittorrent and gnutella . the results presented in the paper may be used for generating synthetic workloads , gaining insights into the functioning of p2p applications , and developing network management strategies . for example , our results suggest that new models are necessary for internet traffic . as a first step , we present flow-level distributional models for web and p2p traffic that may be used in network simulation and emulation experiments .

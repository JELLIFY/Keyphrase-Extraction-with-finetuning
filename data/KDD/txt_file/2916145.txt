rapid detection of significant spatial clusters given an n x n grid of squares , where each square has a count cij and an underlying population pij , our goal is to find the rectangular region with the highest density , and to calculate its significance by randomization . an arbitrary density function d , dependent on a region 's total count c and total population p , can be used . for example , if each count represents the number of disease cases occurring in that square , we can use kulldorff 's spatial scan statistic dk to find the most significant spatial disease cluster . a naive approach to finding the maximum density region requires o ( n4 ) time , and is generally computationally infeasible . we present a multiresolution algorithm which partitions the grid into overlapping regions using a novel overlap-kd tree data structure , bounds the maximum score of subregions contained in each region , and prunes regions which can not contain the maximum density region . for sufficiently dense regions , this method finds the maximum density region in o ( ( n log n ) 2 ) time , in practice resulting in significant ( 20-2000x ) speedups on both real and simulated datasets .

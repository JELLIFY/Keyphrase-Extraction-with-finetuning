from run-time behavior to usage scenarios : an interaction-pattern mining approach a key challenge facing it organizations today is their evolution towards adopting e-business practices that gives rise to the need for reengineering their underlying software systems . any reengineering effort has to be aware of the functional requirements of the subject system , in order not to violate the integrity of its intended uses . however , as software systems get regularly maintained throughout their lifecycle , the documentation of their requirements often become obsolete or get lost . to address this problem of `` software requirements loss '' , we have developed an interaction-pattern mining method for the recovery of functional requirements as usage scenarios . our method analyzes traces of the run-time system-user interaction to discover frequently recurring patterns ; these patterns correspond to the functionality currently exercised by the system users , represented as usage scenarios . the discovered scenarios provide the basis for reengineering the software system into web-accessible components , each one supporting one of the discovered scenarios . in this paper , we describe ipm2 , our interaction-pattern discovery algorithm , we illustrate it with a case study from a real application and we give an overview of the reengineering process in the context of which it is employed .

dynamic coordination of information management services for processing dynamic web content dynamic web content provides us with time-sensitive and continuously changing data . to glean up-to-date information , users need to regularly browse , collect and analyze this web content . without proper tool support this information management task is tedious , time-consuming and error prone , especially when the quantity of the dynamic web content is large , when many information management services are needed to analyze it , and when underlying services\/network are not completely reliable . this paper describes a multi-level , lifecycle ( design-time and run-time ) coordination mechanism that enables rapid , efficient development and execution of information management applications that are especially useful for processing dynamic web content . such a coordination mechanism brings dynamism to coordinating independent , distributed information management services . dynamic parallelism spawns\/merges multiple execution service branches based on available data , and dynamic run-time reconfiguration coordinates service execution to overcome faulty services and bottlenecks . these features enable information management applications to be more efficient in handling content and format changes in web resources , and enable the applications to be evolved and adapted to process dynamic web content .

an environment for collaborative content acquisition and editing by coordinated ubiquitous devices digital content is not only stored by servers on the internet , but also on various embedded devices belonging to ubiquitous networks . in this paper , we propose a content processing mechanism for use in an environment enabling collaborative acquisition of embedded digital content in real-world situations . we have developed a network management device that makes it possible to acquire embedded content using coordinated ubiquitous devices . the management device actively configures a network that includes content-providing devices and browsing devices to permit sharing of various items with digital content . we also developed a functional web mechanism for processing embedded web content in the real-world without a keyboard . this mechanism adds various functions to conventional web content . these functions are activated by messages from a field in a content processing device . we construct a practical prototype system , which is simple enough for children to use , that we called the `` virtual insect catcher '' . through a test with 48 children , we demonstrated that this system can be used to acquire embedded web content , retrieve related content from the internet , and then create new web content . we will also describe the proposed mechanism and the system testing .

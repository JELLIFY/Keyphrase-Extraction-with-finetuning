simulation , verification and automated composition of web services web services -- web-accessible programs and devices - are a key application area for the semantic web . with the proliferation of web services and the evolution towards the semantic web comes the opportunity to automate various web services tasks . our objective is to enable markup and automated reasoning technology to describe , simulate , compose , test , and verify compositions of web services . we take as our starting point the daml-s daml+oil ontology for describing the capabilities of web services . we define the semantics for a relevant subset of daml-s in terms of a first-order logical language . with the semantics in hand , we encode our service descriptions in a petri net formalism and provide decision procedures for web service simulation , verification and composition . we also provide an analysis of the complexity of these tasks under different restrictions to the daml-s composite services we can describe . finally , we present an implementation of our analysis techniques . this implementation takes as input a daml-s description of a web service , automatically generates a petri net and performs the desired analysis . such a tool has broad applicability both as a back end to existing manual web service composition tools , and as a stand-alone tool for web service developers .

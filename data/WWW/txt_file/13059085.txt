layered label propagation : a multiresolution coordinate-free ordering for compressing social networks we continue the line of research on graph compression started with webgraph , but we move our focus to the compression of social networks in a proper sense ( e.g. , livejournal ) : the approaches that have been used for a long time to compress web graphs rely on a specific ordering of the nodes ( lexicographical url ordering ) whose extension to general social networks is not trivial . in this paper , we propose a solution that mixes clusterings and orders , and devise a new algorithm , called layered label propagation , that builds on previous work on scalable clustering and can be used to reorder very large graphs ( billions of nodes ) . our implementation uses task decomposition to perform aggressively on multi-core architecture , making it possible to reorder graphs of more than 600 millions nodes in a few hours . experiments performed on a wide array of web graphs and social networks show that combining the order produced by the proposed algorithm with the webgraph compression framework provides a major increase in compression with respect to all currently known techniques , both on web graphs and on social networks . these improvements make it possible to analyze in main memory significantly larger graphs .

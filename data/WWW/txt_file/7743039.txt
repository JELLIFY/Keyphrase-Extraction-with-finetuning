summarization of online image collections via implicit feedback the availability of map interfaces and location-aware devices makes a growing amount of unstructured , geo-referenced information available on the web . in particular , over twelve million geo-referenced photos are now available on flickr , a popular photo-sharing website . we show a method to analyze the flickr data and generate aggregate knowledge in the form of `` representative tags '' for arbitrary areas in the world . we display these tags on a map interface in an interactive web application along with images associated with each tag . we then use the implicit feedback of the aggregate user interactions with the tags and images to learn which images best describe the area shown on the map .

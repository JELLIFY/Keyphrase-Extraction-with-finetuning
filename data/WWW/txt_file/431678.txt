clarifying the fundamentals of http the simplicity of http was a major factor in the success of the web . however , as both the protocol and its uses have evolved , http has grown complex . this complexity results in numerous problems , including confused implementors , interoperability failures , difficulty in extending the protocol , and a long specification without much documented rationale . many of the problems with http can be traced to unfortunate choices about fundamental definitions and models . this paper analyzes the current ( http\/1 .1 ) protocol design , showing how it fails in certain cases , and how to improve these fundamentals . some problems with http can be fixed simply by adopting new models and terminology , allowing us to think more clearly about implementations and extensions . other problems require explicit ( but compatible ) protocol changes .

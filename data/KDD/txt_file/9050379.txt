automatic identification of quasi-experimental designs for discovering causal knowledge researchers in the social and behavioral sciences routinely rely on quasi-experimental designs to discover knowledge from large data-bases . quasi-experimental designs ( qeds ) exploit fortuitous circumstances in non-experimental data to identify situations ( sometimes called `` natural experiments '' ) that provide the equivalent of experimental control and randomization . qeds allow researchers in domains as diverse as sociology , medicine , and marketing to draw reliable inferences about causal dependencies from non-experimental data . unfortunately , identifying and exploiting qeds has remained a painstaking manual activity , requiring researchers to scour available databases and apply substantial knowledge of statistics . however , recent advances in the expressiveness of databases , and increases in their size and complexity , provide the necessary conditions to automatically identify qeds . in this paper , we describe the first system to discover knowledge by applying quasi-experimental designs that were identified automatically . we demonstrate that qeds can be identified in a traditional database schema and that such identification requires only a small number of extensions to that schema , knowledge about quasi-experimental design encoded in first-order logic , and a theorem-proving engine . we describe several key innovations necessary to enable this system , including methods for automatically constructing appropriate experimental units and for creating aggregate variables on those units . we show that applying the resulting designs can identify important causal dependencies in real domains , and we provide examples from academic publishing , movie making and marketing , and peer-production systems . finally , we discuss the integration of qeds with other approaches to causal discovery , including joint modeling and directed experimentation .

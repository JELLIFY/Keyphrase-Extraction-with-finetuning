a framework for community identification in dynamic social networks we propose frameworks and algorithms for identifying communities in social networks that change over time . communities are intuitively characterized as `` unusually densely knit '' subsets of a social network . this notion becomes more problematic if the social interactions change over time . aggregating social networks over time can radically misrepresent the existing and changing community structure . instead , we propose an optimization-based approach for modeling dynamic community structure . we prove that finding the most explanatory community structure is np-hard and apx-hard , and propose algorithms based on dynamic programming , exhaustive search , maximum matching , and greedy heuristics . we demonstrate empirically that the heuristics trace developments of community structure accurately for several synthetic and real-world examples .

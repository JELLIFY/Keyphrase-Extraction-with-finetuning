live web search experiments for the rest of us there are significant barriers to academic research into user web search preferences . academic researchers are unable to manipulate the results shown by a major search engine to users and would have no access to the interaction data collected by the engine . our initial approach to overcoming this was to ask participants to submit queries to an experimental search engine rather than their usual search tool . over several different experiments we found that initial user buy-in was high but that people quickly drifted back to their old habits and stopped contributing data . here , we report our investigation of possible reasons why this occurs . an alternative approach is exemplified by the lemur browser toolbar , which allows local collection of user interaction data from search engine sessions , but does not allow result pages to be modified . we will demonstrate a new firefox toolbar that we have developed to support experiments in which search results may be arbitrarily manipulated . using our toolbar , academics can set up the experiments they want to conduct , while collecting ( subject to human experimentation guidelines ) queries , clicks and dwell times as well as optional explicit judgments .

unparsing rdf\/xml it is difficult to serialize an rdf graph as a humanly readable rdf\/xml document . this paper describes the approach taken in jena 1.2 , in which a design pattern of guarded procedures invoked using top down recursive descent is used . each procedure corresponds to a grammar rule ; the guard makes the choice about the applicability of the production . this approach is seen to correspond closely to the design of an ll ( k ) parser , and a theoretical justification of this correspondence is found in universal algebra .

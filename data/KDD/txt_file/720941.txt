why collective inference improves relational classification procedures for collective inference make simultaneous statistical judgments about the same variables for a set of related data instances . for example , collective inference could be used to simultaneously classify a set of hyperlinked documents or infer the legitimacy of a set of related financial transactions . several recent studies indicate that collective inference can significantly reduce classification error when compared with traditional inference techniques . we investigate the underlying mechanisms for this error reduction by reviewing past work on collective inference and characterizing different types of statistical models used for making inference in relational data . we show important differences among these models , and we characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions for reduced classification error based on experiments with real and simulated data .

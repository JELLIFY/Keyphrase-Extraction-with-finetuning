efficient search engine measurements we address the problem of measuring global quality met-rics of search engines , like corpus size , index freshness , anddensity of duplicates in the corpus . the recently proposedestimators for such metrics ( 2 , 6 ) suffer from significant biasand\/or poor performance , due to inaccurate approximationof the so called . document degrees . . we present two new estimators that are able to overcomethe bias introduced by approximate degrees . our estimatorsare based on a careful implementation of an approximateimportance sampling procedure . comprehensive theoreti-cal and empirical analysis of the estimators demonstratesthat they have essentially no bias even in situations wheredocument degrees are poorly approximated . building on an idea from ( 6 ) , we discuss rao blackwelliza-tion as a generic method for reducing variance in searchengine estimators . we show that rao-blackwellizing ourestimators results in significant performance improvements , while not compromising accuracy .

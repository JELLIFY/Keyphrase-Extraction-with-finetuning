coa : finding novel patents through text analysis in recent years , the number of patents filed by the business enterprises in the technology industry are growing rapidly , thus providing unprecedented opportunities for knowledge discovery in patent data . one important task in this regard is to employ data mining techniques to rank patents in terms of their potential to earn money through licensing . availability of such ranking can substantially reduce enterprise ip ( intellectual property ) management costs . unfortunately , the existing software systems in the ip domain do not address this task directly . through our research , we build a patent ranking software , named coa ( claim originality analysis ) that rates a patent based on its value by measuring the recency and the impact of the important phrases that appear in the `` claims '' section of a patent . experiments show that coa produces meaningful ranking when comparing it with other indirect patent evaluation metrics -- citation count , patent status , and attorney 's rating . in reallife settings , this tool was used by beta-testers in the ibm ip department . lawyers found it very useful in patent rating , specifically , in highlighting potentially valuable patents in a patent cluster . in this article , we describe the ranking techniques and system architecture of coa . we also present the results that validate its effectiveness .

using visual cues for extraction of tabular data from arbitrary html documents we describe a method to extract tabular data from web pages . rather than just analyzing the dom tree , we also exploit visual cues in the rendered version of the document to extract data from tables which are not explicitly marked with an html table element . to detect tables , we rely on a variant of the well-known x-y cut algorithm as used in the ocr community . we implemented the system by directly accessing mozilla 's box model that contains the positional data for all html elements of a given web page .

recovering latent time-series from their observed sums : network tomography with particle filters . hidden variables , evolving over time , appear in multiple settings , where it is valuable to recover them , typically from observed sums . our driving application is ` network tomography ' , where we need to estimate the origin-destination ( od ) traffic flows to determine , e.g. , who is communicating with whom in a local area network . this information allows network engineers and managers to solve problems in design , routing , configuration debugging , monitoring and pricing . unfortunately the direct measurement of the od traffic is usually difficult , or even impossible ; instead , we can easily measure the loads on every link , that is , sums of desirable od flows . in this paper we propose i-filter , a method to solve this problem , which improves the state-of-the-art by ( a ) introducing explicit time dependence , and by ( b ) using realistic , non-gaussian marginals in the statistical models for the traffic flows , as never attempted before . we give experiments on real data , where i-filter scales linearly with new observations and out-performs the best existing solutions , in a wide variety of settings . specifically , on real network traffic measured at cmu , and at at&t , i-filter reduced the estimation errors between 15 % and 46 % in all cases .

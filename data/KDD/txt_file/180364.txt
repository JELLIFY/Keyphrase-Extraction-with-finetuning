indexing multi-dimensional time-series with support for multiple distance measures although most time-series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function , in this work we motivate the need for a single index structure that can support multiple distance measures . our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities . trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications , mobility experiments , video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns . our primary similarity measure is based on the longest common subsequence ( lcss ) model , that offers enhanced robustness , particularly for noisy data , which are encountered very often in real world applications . however , our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well , including the ubiquitous euclidean distance , and the increasingly popular dynamic time warping ( dtw ) . while other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures , a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index . our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision\/recall . the experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed-up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the lcss and the dtw .

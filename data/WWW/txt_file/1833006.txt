a smart hill-climbing algorithm for application server configuration the overwhelming success of the web as a mechanism for facilitating information retrieval and for conducting business transactions has ledto an increase in the deployment of complex enterprise applications . these applications typically run on web application servers , which assume the burden of managing many tasks , such as concurrency , memory management , database access , etc. , required by these applications . the performance of an application server depends heavily on appropriate configuration . configuration is a difficult and error-prone task dueto the large number of configuration parameters and complex interactions between them . we formulate the problem of finding an optimal configuration for a given application as a black-box optimization problem . we propose a smart hill-climbing algorithm using ideas of importance sampling and latin hypercube sampling ( lhs ) . the algorithm is efficient in both searching and random sampling . it consists of estimating a local function , and then , hill-climbing in the steepest descent direction . the algorithm also learns from past searches and restarts in a smart and selective fashion using the idea of importance sampling . we have carried out extensive experiments with an on-line brokerage application running in a websphere environment . empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm is more efficient than and superior to traditional heuristic methods .

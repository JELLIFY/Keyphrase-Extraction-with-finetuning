facetnet : a framework for analyzing communities and their evolutions in dynamic networks we discover communities from social network data , and analyze the community evolution . these communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks , as well as paper citation networks . also , communities may evolve over time , due to changes to individuals ' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals ' research interests . we present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions . in the traditional approach , communities are first detected for each time slice , and then compared to determine correspondences . we argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data . in this paper , we propose facetnet for analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robust unified process . in this novel framework , communities not only generate evolutions , they also are regularized by the temporal smoothness of evolutions . as a result , this framework will discover communities that jointly maximize the fit to the observed data and the temporal evolution . our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of non-negative matrix factorization , where communities and their evolutions are factorized in a unified way . then we develop an iterative algorithm , with proven low time complexity , which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution . we perform extensive experimental studies , on both synthetic datasets and real datasets , to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods .

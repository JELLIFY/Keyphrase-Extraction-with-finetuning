page-level template detection via isotonic smoothing we develop a novel framework for the page-level template detection problem . our framework is built on two main ideas . the first is theautomatic generation of training data for a classifier that , given apage , assigns a templateness score to every dom node of the page . the second is the global smoothing of these per-node classifier scores bysolving a regularized isotonic regression problem ; the latter follows from a simple yet powerful abstraction of templateness on a page . our extensive experiments on human-labeled test data show that our approachdetects templates effectively .

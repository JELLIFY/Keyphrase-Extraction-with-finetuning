cc-buddy : an adaptive framework for maintaining cache coherency using peers in this paper , we propose a framework called cc-buddy , for maintaining dynamic data coherency in peer-to-peer environment . working on the basis of peer heterogeneity in data coherency requirement , peers in cc-buddy cooperate with each other to disseminate the updates by pushing . simulation results show that our solution not only improves the fidelity in data , but also reduces the workload of servers , therefore achieves high-scalability .

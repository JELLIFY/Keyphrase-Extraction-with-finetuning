multiple domain user personalization content personalization is a key tool in creating attractive websites . synergies can be obtained by integrating personalization between several internet properties . in this paper we propose a hierarchical bayesian model to address these issues . our model allows the integration of multiple properties without changing the overall structure , which makes it easily extensible across large internet portals . it relies at its lowest level on latent dirichlet allocation , while making use of latent side features for cross-property integration . we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by analyzing data from several properties of a major internet portal .

proximity within paragraph : a measure to enhance document retrieval performance we created a proximity measure , called proximity within paragraph ( pwp ) , which is based on the concept of value assignment to queried words , grouped by associated ideas within paragraphs . based on the wt10g dataset , a test system comprising three test sets and fifty queries were constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of pwp by comparing it with the existing method : minimum distance between queried pairs . a further experiment combines the scores obtained from both methods and the results suggest that the combination can significantly improve the effectiveness .

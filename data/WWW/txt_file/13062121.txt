a self-training approach for resolving object coreference on the semantic web an object on the semantic web is likely to be denoted with multiple uris by different parties . object coreference resolution is to identify `` equivalent '' uris that denote the same object . driven by the linking open data ( lod ) initiative , millions of uris have been explicitly linked with owl : sameas statements , but potentially coreferent ones are still considerable . existing approaches address the problem mainly from two directions : one is based upon equivalence inference mandated by owl semantics , which finds semantically coreferent uris but probably omits many potential ones ; the other is via similarity computation between property-value pairs , which is not always accurate enough . in this paper , we propose a self-training approach for object coreference resolution on the semantic web , which leverages the two classes of approaches to bridge the gap between semantically coreferent uris and potential candidates . for an object uri , we firstly establish a kernel that consists of semantically coreferent uris based on owl : sameas , ( inverse ) functional properties and ( max - ) cardinalities , and then extend such kernel iteratively in terms of discriminative property-value pairs in the descriptions of uris . in particular , the discriminability is learned with a statistical measurement , which not only exploits key characteristics for representing an object , but also takes into account the matchability between properties from pragmatics . in addition , frequent property combinations are mined to improve the accuracy of the resolution . we implement a scalable system and demonstrate that our approach achieves good precision and recall for resolving object coreference , on both benchmark and large-scale datasets .

rapid prototyping of semantic mash-ups through semantic web pipes the use of rdf data published on the web for applications is still a cumbersome and resource-intensive task due to the limited software support and the lack of standard programming paradigms to deal with everyday problems such as combination of rdf data from dierent sources , object identifier consolidation , ontology alignment and mediation , or plain querying and filtering tasks . in this paper we present a framework , semantic web pipes , that supports fast implementation of semantic data mash-ups while preserving desirable properties such as abstraction , encapsulation , component-orientation , code re-usability and maintainability which are common and well supported in other application areas .

pattern-based similarity search for microarray data one fundamental task in near-neighbor search as well as other similarity matching efforts is to find a distance function that can efficiently quantify the similarity between two objects in a meaningful way . in dna microarray analysis , the expression levels of two closely related genes may rise and fall synchronously in response to a set of experimental stimuli . although the magnitude of their expression levels may not be close , the patterns they exhibit can be very similar . unfortunately , none of the conventional distance metrics such as the lp norm can model this similarity effectively . in this paper , we study the near-neighbor search problem based on this new type of similarity . we propose to measure the distance between two genes by subspace pattern similarity , i.e. , whether they exhibit a synchronous pattern of rise and fall on a subset of dimensions . we then present an efficient algorithm for subspace near-neighbor search based on pattern similarity distance , and we perform tests on various data sets to show its effectiveness .

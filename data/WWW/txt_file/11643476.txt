money , glory and cheap talk : analyzing strategic behavior of contestants in simultaneous crowdsourcing contests on topcoder.com crowdsourcing is a new web phenomenon , in which a firm takes a function once performed in-house and outsources it to a crowd , usually in the form of an open contest . designing efficient crowdsourcing mechanisms is not possible without deep understanding of incentives and strategic choices of all participants . this paper presents an empirical analysis of determinants of individual performance in multiple simultaneous crowdsourcing contests using a unique dataset for the world 's largest competitive software development portal : topcoder.com . special attention is given to studying the effects of the reputation system currently used by topcoder.com on behavior of contestants . we find that individual specific traits together with the project payment and the number of project requirements are significant predictors of the final project quality . furthermore , we find significant evidence of strategic behavior of contestants . high rated contestants face tougher competition from their opponents in the competition phase of the contest . in order to soften the competition , they move first in the registration phase of the contest , signing up early for particular projects . although registration in topcoder contests is non-binding , it deters entry of opponents in the same contest ; our lower bound estimate shows that this strategy generates significant surplus gain to high rated contestants . we conjecture that the reputation + cheap talk mechanism employed by topcoder has a positive effect on allocative efficiency of simultaneous all-pay contests and should be considered for adoption in other crowdsourcing platforms .

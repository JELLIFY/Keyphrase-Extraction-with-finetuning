who says what to whom on twitter we study several longstanding questions in media communications research , in the context of the microblogging service twitter , regarding the production , flow , and consumption of information . to do so , we exploit a recently introduced feature of twitter known as `` lists '' to distinguish between elite users - by which we mean celebrities , bloggers , and representatives of media outlets and other formal organizations - and ordinary users . based on this classification , we find a striking concentration of attention on twitter , in that roughly 50 % of urls consumed are generated by just 20k elite users , where the media produces the most information , but celebrities are the most followed . we also find significant homophily within categories : celebrities listen to celebrities , while bloggers listen to bloggers etc ; however , bloggers in general rebroadcast more information than the other categories . next we re-examine the classical `` two-step flow '' theory of communications , finding considerable support for it on twitter . third , we find that urls broadcast by different categories of users or containing different types of content exhibit systematically different lifespans . and finally , we examine the attention paid by the different user categories to different news topics .

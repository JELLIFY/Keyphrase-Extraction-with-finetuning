relational learning via latent social dimensions social media such as blogs , facebook , flickr , etc. , presents data in a network format rather than classical iid distribution . to address the interdependency among data instances , relational learning has been proposed , and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction . however , connections in social media are often multi-dimensional . an actor can connect to another actor for different reasons , e.g. , alumni , colleagues , living in the same city , sharing similar interests , etc. . collective inference normally does not differentiate these connections . in this work , we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information , and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning . these social dimensions describe diverse affiliations of actors hidden in the network , and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which affiliations are better aligned with the class labels . such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network . we conduct extensive experiments on social media data ( one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site ) . our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference , especially when few labeled data are available . the sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined .

epci : extracting potentially copyright infringement texts from the web in this paper , we propose a new system extracting potentially copyright infringement texts from the web , called epci . epci extracts them in the following way : ( 1 ) generating a set of queries based on a given copyright reserved seed-text , ( 2 ) putting every query to search engine api , ( 3 ) gathering the search result web pages from high ranking until the similarity between the given seed-text and the search result pages becomes less than a given threshold value , and ( 4 ) merging all the gathered pages , then re-ranking them in the order of their similarity . our experimental result using 40 seed-texts shows that epci is able to extract 132 potentially copyright infringement web pages per a given copyright reserved seed-text with 94 % precision in average .

tumor cell identification using features rules advances in imaging techniques have led to large repositories of images . there is an increasing demand for automated systems that can analyze complex medical images and extract meaningful information for mining patterns . here , we describe a real-life image mining application to the problem of tumor cell counting . the quantitative analysis of tumor cells is fundamental to characterizing the activity of tumor cells . existing approaches are mostly manual , time-consuming and subjective . efforts to automate the process of cell counting have largely focused on using image processing techniques only . our studies indicate that image processing alone is unable to give accurate results . in this paper , we examine the use of extracted features rules to aid in the process of tumor cell counting . we propose a robust local adaptive thresholding and dynamic water immersion algorithms to segment regions of interesting from background . meaningful features are then extracted from the segmented regions . a number of base classifiers are built to generate features rules to help identify the tumor cell . two voting strategies are implemented to combine the base classifiers into a meta-classifier . experiment results indicate that this process of using extracted features rules to help identify tumor cell leads to better accuracy than pure image processing techniques alone .

a streaming ensemble algorithm ( sea ) for large-scale classification ensemble methods have recently garnered a great deal of attention in the machine learning community . techniques such as boosting and bagging have proven to be highly effective but require repeated resampling of the training data , making them inappropriate in a data mining context . the methods presented in this paper take advantage of plentiful data , building separate classifiers on sequential chunks of training points . these classifiers are combined into a fixed-size ensemble using a heuristic replacement strategy . the result is a fast algorithm for large-scale or streaming data that classifies as well as a single decision tree built on all the data , requires approximately constant memory , and adjusts quickly to concept drift .

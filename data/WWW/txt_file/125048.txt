named graphs , provenance and trust the semantic web consists of many rdf graphs nameable by uris . this paper extends the syntax and semantics of rdf to cover such named graphs . this enables rdf statements that describe graphs , which is beneficial in many semantic web application areas . as a case study , we explore the application area of semantic web publishing : named graphs allow publishers to communicate assertional intent , and to sign their graphs ; information consumers can evaluate specific graphs using task-specific trust policies , and act on information from those named graphs that they accept . graphs are trusted depending on : their content ; information about the graph ; and the task the user is performing . the extension of rdf to named graphs provides a formally defined framework to be a foundation for the semantic web trust layer .

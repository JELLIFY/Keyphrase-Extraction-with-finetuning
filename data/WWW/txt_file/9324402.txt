a dynamic bayesian network click model for web search ranking as with any application of machine learning , web search ranking requires labeled data . the labels usually come in the form of relevance assessments made by editors . click logs can also provide an important source of implicit feedback and can be used as a cheap proxy for editorial labels . the main difficulty however comes from the so called position bias - urls appearing in lower positions are less likely to be clicked even if they are relevant . in this paper , we propose a dynamic bayesian network which aims at providing us with unbiased estimation of the relevance from the click logs . experiments show that the proposed click model outperforms other existing click models in predicting both click-through rate and relevance .

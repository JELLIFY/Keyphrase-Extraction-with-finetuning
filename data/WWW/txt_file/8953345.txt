processing link structures and linkbases on the web hyperlinks are an essential feature of the world wide web , highly responsible for its success . xlink improves on html 's linking capabilities in several ways . in particular , links after xlink can be `` out-of-line '' ( i.e. , not defined at a link source ) and collected in ( possibly several ) linkbases , which considerably ease building complex link structures . modeling of link structures and processing of linkbases under the web 's `` open world linking '' are aspects neglected by xlink . adding a notion of `` interface '' to xlink , as suggested in this work , considerably improves modeling of link structures . when a link structure is traversed , the relevant linkbase ( s ) might become ambiguous . we suggest three linkbase management modes governing the binding of a linkbase to a document to resolve this ambiguity .

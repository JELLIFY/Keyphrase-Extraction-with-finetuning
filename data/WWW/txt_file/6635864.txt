subspace : secure cross-domain communication for web mashups combining data and code from third-party sources has enabled a new wave of web mashups that add creativity and functionality to web applications . however , browsers are poorly designed to pass data between domains , often forcing web developers to abandon security in the name of functionality . to address this deficiency , we developed subspace , a cross-domain communication mechanism that allows efficient communication across domains without sacrificing security . our prototype requires only a small javascript library , and works across all major browsers . we believe subspace can serve as a new secure communication primitive for web mashups .

olap on search logs : an infrastructure supporting data-driven applications in search engines search logs , which contain rich and up-to-date information about users ' needs and preferences , have become a critical data source for search engines . recently , more and more data-driven applications are being developed in search engines based on search logs , such as query suggestion , keyword bidding , and dissatisfactory query analysis . in this paper , by observing that many data-driven applications in search engines highly rely on online mining of search logs , we develop an olap system on search logs which serves as an infrastructure supporting various data-driven applications . an empirical study using real data of over two billion query sessions demonstrates the usefulness and feasibility of our design .

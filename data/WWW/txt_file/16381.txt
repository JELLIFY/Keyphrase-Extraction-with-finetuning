semtag and seeker : bootstrapping the semantic web via automated semantic annotation this paper describes seeker , a platform for large-scale text analytics , and semtag , an application written on the platform to perform automated semantic tagging of large corpora . we apply semtag to a collection of approximately 264 million web pages , and generate approximately 434 million automatically disambiguated semantic tags , published to the web as a label bureau providing metadata regarding the 434 million annotations . to our knowledge , this is the largest scale semantic tagging effort to date . we describe the seeker platform , discuss the architecture of the semtag application , describe a new disambiguation algorithm specialized to support ontological disambiguation of large-scale data , evaluate the algorithm , and present our final results with information about acquiring and making use of the semantic tags . we argue that automated large scale semantic tagging of ambiguous content can bootstrap and accelerate the creation of the semantic web .

the xml web : a first study although originally designed for large-scale electronic publishing , xml plays an increasingly important role in the exchange of data on the web . in fact , it is expected that xml will become the lingua franca of the web , eventually replacing html . not surprisingly , there has been a great deal of interest on xml both in industry and in academia . nevertheless , to date no comprehensive study on the xml web ( i.e. , the subset of the web made of xml documents only ) nor on its contents has been made . this paper is the first attempt at describing the xml web and the documents contained in it . our results are drawn from a sample of a repository of the publicly available xml documents on the web , consisting of about 200,000 documents . our results show that , despite its short history , xml already permeates the web , both in terms of generic domains and geographically . also , our results about the contents of the xml web provide valuable input for the design of algorithms , tools and systems that use xml in one form or another .

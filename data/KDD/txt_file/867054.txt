pattern discovery in sequences under a markov assumption in this paper we investigate the general problem of discovering recurrent patterns that are embedded in categorical sequences . an important real-world problem of this nature is motif discovery in dna sequences . we investigate the fundamental aspects of this data mining problem that can make discovery `` easy '' or `` hard . '' we present a general framework for characterizing learning in this context by deriving the bayes error rate for this problem under a markov assumption . the bayes error framework demonstrates why certain patterns are much harder to discover than others . it also explains the role of different parameters such as pattern length and pattern frequency in sequential discovery . we demonstrate how the bayes error can be used to calibrate existing discovery algorithms , providing a lower bound on achievable performance . we discuss a number of fundamental issues that characterize sequential pattern discovery in this context , present a variety of empirical results to complement and verify the theoretical analysis , and apply our methodology to real-world motif-discovery problems in computational biology .

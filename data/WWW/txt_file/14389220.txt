strategic formation of credit networks credit networks are an abstraction for modeling trust between agents in a network . agents who do not directly trust each other can transact through exchange of ious ( obligations ) along a chain of trust in the network . credit networks are robust to intrusion , can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies , and have the liquidity to support a high rate of transactions . we study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other . when each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents , and transacts directly only with those it trusts , the formation game is a potential game and all nash equilibria are social optima . moreover , the nash equilibria of this game are equivalent in a very strong sense : the sequences of transactions that can be supported from each equilibrium credit network are identical . when we allow transactions over longer paths , the game may not admit a nash equilibrium , and even when it does , the price of anarchy may be unbounded . hence , we study two special cases . first , when agents have a shared belief about the trustworthiness of each agent , the networks formed in equilibrium have a star-like structure . though the price of anarchy is unbounded , myopic best response quickly converges to a social optimum . similar star-like structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via simulation . in addition , we simulate a second case where agents may have varying information about each others ' trustworthiness based on their distance in a social network . empirical game analysis of these scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are relatively rare , and otherwise , credit tends to be issued over short social distances conforming to the locality of information .

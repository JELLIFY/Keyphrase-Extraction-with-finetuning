a dea approach for model combination this paper proposes a novel data envelopment analysis ( dea ) based approach for model combination . we first prove that for the 2-class classification problems dea models identify the same convex hull as the popular roc analysis used for model combination . for general k-class classifiers , we then develop a dea-based method to combine multiple classifiers . experiments show that the method outperforms other benchmark methods and suggest that dea can be a promising tool for model combination .

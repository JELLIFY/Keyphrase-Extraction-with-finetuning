extraction and classification of dense communities in the web the world wide web ( www ) is rapidly becoming important for society as a medium for sharing data , information and services , and there is a growing interest in tools for understanding collective behaviors and emerging phenomena in the www . in this paper we focus on the problem of searching and classifying communities in the web . loosely speaking a community is a group of pages related to a common interest . more formally communities have been associated in the computer science literature with the existence of a locally dense sub-graph of the web-graph ( where web pages are nodes and hyper-links are arcs of the web-graph ) . the core of our contribution is a new scalable algorithm for finding relatively dense subgraphs in massive graphs . we apply our algorithm on web-graphs built on three publicly available large crawls of the web ( with raw sizes up to 120m nodes and 1g arcs ) . the effectiveness of our algorithm in finding dense subgraphs is demonstrated experimentally by embedding artificial communities in the web-graph and counting how many of these are blindly found . effectiveness increases with the size and density of the communities : it is close to 100 % for communities of a thirty nodes or more ( even at low density ) . it is still about 80 % even for communities of twenty nodes with density over 50 % of the arcs present . at the lower extremes the algorithm catches 35 % of dense communities made of ten nodes . we complete our community watch system by clustering the communities found in the web-graph into homogeneous groups by topic and labeling each group by representative keywords .

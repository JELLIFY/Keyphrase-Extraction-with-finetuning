pebl : positive example based learning for web page classification using svm web page classification is one of the essential techniques for web mining . specifically , classifying web pages of a user-interesting class is the first step of mining interesting information from the web . however , constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples . for instance , in order to construct a `` homepage '' classifier , one needs to collect a sample of homepages ( positive examples ) and a sample of non-homepages ( negative examples ) . in particular , collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and special caution to avoid biasing them . we introduce in this paper the positive example based learning ( pebl ) framework for web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in pre-processing . we present an algorithm called mapping-convergence ( m-c ) that achieves classification accuracy ( with positive and unlabeled data ) as high as that of traditional svm ( with positive and negative data ) . our experiments show that when the m-c algorithm uses the same amount of positive examples as that of traditional svm , the m-c algorithm performs as well as traditional svm .

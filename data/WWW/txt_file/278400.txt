an xpath-based preference language for p3p the platform for privacy preferences ( p3p ) is the most significant effort currently underway to enable web users to gain control over their private information . the designers of p3p simultaneously designed a preference language called appel to allow users to express their privacy preferences , thus enabling automatic matching of privacy preferences against p3p policies . unfortunately subtle interactions between p3p and appel result in serious problems when using appel : users can only directly specify what is unacceptable in a policy , not what is acceptable ; simple preferences are hard to express ; and writing appel preferences is error prone . we show that these problems follow from a fundamental design choice made by appel , and can not be solved without completely redesigning the language . therefore we explore alternatives to appel that can overcome these problems . in particular , we show that xpath serves quite nicely as a preference language and solves all the above problems . we identify the minimal subset of xpath that is needed , thus allowing matching programs to potentially use a smaller memory footprint . we also give an appel to xpath translator that shows that xpath is as expressive as appel .

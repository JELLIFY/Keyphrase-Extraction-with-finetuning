the volume and evolution of web page templates web pages contain a combination of unique content and template material , which is present across multiple pages and used primarily for formatting , navigation , and branding . we study the nature , evolution , and prevalence of these templates on the web . as part of this work , we develop new randomized algorithms for template extraction that perform approximately twenty times faster than existing approaches with similar quality . our results show that 40 -- 50 % of the content on the web is template content . over the last eight years , the fraction of template content has doubled , and the growth shows no sign of abating . text , links , and total html bytes within templates are all growing as a fraction of total content at a rate of between 6 and 8 % per year . we discuss the deleterious implications of this growth for information retrieval and ranking , classification , and link analysis .

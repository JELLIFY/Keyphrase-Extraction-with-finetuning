an integrated framework on mining logs files for computing system management traditional approaches to system management have been largely based on domain experts through a knowledge acquisition process that translates domain knowledge into operating rules and policies . this has been well known and experienced as a cumbersome , labor intensive , and error prone process . in addition , this process is difficult to keep up with the rapidly changing environments . in this paper , we will describe our research efforts on establishing an integrated framework for mining system log files for automatic management . in particular , we apply text mining techniques to categorize messages in log files into common situations , improve categorization accuracy by considering the temporal characteristics of log messages , develop temporal mining techniques to discover the relationships between different events , and utilize visualization tools to evaluate and validate the interesting temporal patterns for system management .

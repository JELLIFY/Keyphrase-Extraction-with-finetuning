treedt : gene mapping by tree disequilibrium test we introduce and evaluate treedt , a novel gene mapping method which is based on discovering and assessing tree-like patterns in genetic marker data . gene mapping aims at discovering a statistical connection from a particular disease or trait to a narrow region in the genome . in a typical case-control setting , data consists of genetic markers typed for a set of disease-associated chromosomes and a set of control chromosomes . a computer scientist would view this data as a set of strings . treedt extracts , essentially in the form of substrings and prefix trees , information about the historical recombinations in the population . this information is used to locate fragments potentially inherited from a common diseased founder , and to map the disease gene into the most likely such fragment . the method measures for each chromosomal location the disequilibrium of the prefix tree of marker strings starting from the location , to assess the distribution of disease-associated chromosomes . we evaluate experimentally the performance of treedt on realistic , simulated data sets , and comparisons to state of the art methods ( tdt , hpm ) show that treedt is very competitive .

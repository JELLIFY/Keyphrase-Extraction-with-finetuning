density-based clustering for real-time stream data existing data-stream clustering algorithms such as clustream arebased on k-means . these clustering algorithms are incompetent tofind clusters of arbitrary shapes and can not handle outliers . further , they require the knowledge of k and user-specified time window . to address these issues , this paper proposes d-stream , a framework for clustering stream data using adensity-based approach . the algorithm uses an online component which maps each input data record into a grid and an offline component which computes the grid density and clusters the grids based on the density . the algorithm adopts a density decaying technique to capture the dynamic changes of a data stream . exploiting the intricate relationships between the decay factor , data density and cluster structure , our algorithm can efficiently and effectively generate and adjust the clusters in real time . further , a theoretically sound technique is developed to detect and remove sporadic grids mapped to by outliers in order to dramatically improve the space and time efficiency of the system . the technique makes high-speed data stream clustering feasible without degrading the clustering quality . the experimental results show that our algorithm has superior quality and efficiency , can find clusters of arbitrary shapes , and can accurately recognize the evolving behaviors of real-time data streams .

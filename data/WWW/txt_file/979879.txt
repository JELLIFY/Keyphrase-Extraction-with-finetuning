semrank : ranking complex relationship search results on the semantic web while the idea that querying mechanisms for complex relationships ( otherwise known as semantic associations ) should be integral to semantic web search technologies has recently gained some ground , the issue of how search results will be ranked remains largely unaddressed . since it is expected that the number of relationships between entities in a knowledge base will be much larger than the number of entities themselves , the likelihood that semantic association searches would result in an overwhelming number of results for users is increased , therefore elevating the need for appropriate ranking schemes . furthermore , it is unlikely that ranking schemes for ranking entities ( documents , resources , etc. ) may be applied to complex structures such as semantic associations . in this paper , we present an approach that ranks results based on how predictable a result might be for users . it is based on a relevance model semrank , which is a rich blend of semantic and information-theoretic techniques with heuristics that supports the novel idea of modulative searches , where users may vary their search modes to effect changes in the ordering of results depending on their need . we also present the infrastructure used in the ssark system to support the computation of semrank values for resulting semantic associations and their ordering .

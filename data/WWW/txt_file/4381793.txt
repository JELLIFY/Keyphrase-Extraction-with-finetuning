discovering event evolution graphs from newswires in this paper , we propose an approach to automatically mine event evolution graphs from newswires on the web . event evolution graph is a directed graph in which the vertices and edges denote news events and the evolutions between events respectively , in a news affair . our model utilizes the content similarity between events and incorporates temporal proximity and document distributional proximity as decaying functions . our approach is effective in presenting the inside developments of news affairs along the timeline , which can facilitate users ' information browsing tasks .

xml-based xml schema access xml schema 's abstract data model consists of components , which are the structures that eventually define a schema as a whole . xml schema 's xml syntax , on the other hand , is not a direct representation of the schema components , and it proves to be surprisingly hard to derive a schema 's components from the xml syntax . the schema component xml syntax ( scx ) is a representation which attempts to map schema components as faithfully as possible to xml structures . scx serves as the starting point for applications which need access to schema components and want to do so using standardized and widely available xml technologies .

knowledge sharing and yahoo answers : everyone knows something yahoo answers ( ya ) is a large and diverse question-answer forum , acting not only as a medium for sharing technical knowledge , but as a place where one can seek advice , gather opinions , and satisfy one 's curiosity about a countless number of things . in this paper , we seek to understand ya 's knowledge sharing and activity . we analyze the forum categories and cluster them according to content characteristics and patterns of interaction among the users . while interactions in some categories resemble expertise sharing forums , others incorporate discussion , everyday advice , and support . with such a diversity of categories in which one can participate , we find that some users focus narrowly on specific topics , while others participate across categories . this not only allows us to map related categories , but to characterize the entropy of the users ' interests . we find that lower entropy correlates with receiving higher answer ratings , but only for categories where factual expertise is primarily sought after . we combine both user attributes and answer characteristics to predict , within a given category , whether a particular answer will be chosen as the best answer by the asker .

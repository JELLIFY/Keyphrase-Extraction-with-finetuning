bias and controversy : beyond the statistical deviation in this paper , we investigate how deviation in evaluation activities may reveal bias on the part of reviewers and controversy on the part of evaluated objects . we focus on a ` data-centric approach ' where the evaluation data is assumed to represent the ` ground truth ' . the standard statistical approaches take evaluation and deviation at face value . we argue that attention should be paid to the subjectivity of evaluation , judging the evaluation score not just on ` what is being said ' ( deviation ) , but also on ` who says it ' ( reviewer ) as well as on ` whom it is said about ' ( object ) . furthermore , we observe that bias and controversy are mutually dependent , as there is more bias if there is higher deviation on a less controversial object . to address this mutual dependency , we propose a reinforcement model to identify bias and controversy . we test our model on real-life data to verify its applicability .

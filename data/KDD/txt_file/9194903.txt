combinational collaborative filtering for personalized community recommendation rapid growth in the amount of data available on social networking sites has made information retrieval increasingly challenging for users . in this paper , we propose a collaborative filtering method , combinational collaborative filtering ( ccf ) , to perform personalized community recommendations by considering multiple types of co-occurrences in social data at the same time . this filtering method fuses semantic and user information , then applies a hybrid training strategy that combines gibbs sampling and expectation-maximization algorithm . to handle the large-scale dataset , parallel computing is used to speed up the model training . through an empirical study on the orkut dataset , we show ccf to be both effective and scalable .

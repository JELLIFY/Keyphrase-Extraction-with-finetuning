mining viewpoint patterns in image databases the increasing number of image repositories has made image mining an important task because of its potential in discovering useful image patterns from a large set of images . in this paper , we introduce the notion of viewpoint patterns for image databases . viewpoint patterns refer to patterns that capture the invariant relationships of one object from the point of view of another object . these patterns are unique and significant in images because the absolute positional information of objects for most images is not important , but rather , it is the relative distance and orientation of the objects from each other that is meaningful . we design a scalable and efficient algorithm to discover such viewpoint patterns . experiments results on various image sets demonstrate that viewpoint patterns are meaningful and interesting to human users .

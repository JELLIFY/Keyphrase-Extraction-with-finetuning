automated synthesis of executable web service compositions from bpel4ws processes we propose a technique for the automated synthesis of new composite web services . given a set of abstract bpel4ws descriptions of component services , and a composition requirement , we automatically generate a concrete bpel4ws process that , when executed , interacts with the components and satisfies the requirement . we implement the proposed approach exploiting efficient representation techniques , and we show its scalability over case studies taken from a real world application and over a parameterized domain .

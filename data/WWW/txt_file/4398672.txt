bringing communities to the semantic web and the semantic web to communities in this paper we consider the types of community networks that are most often codified within the semantic web . we propose the recognition of a new structure which fulfils the definition of community used outside the semantic web . we argue that the properties inherent in a community allow additional processing to be done with the described relationships existing between entities within the community network . taking an existing online community as a case study we describe the ontologies and applications that we developed to support this community in the semantic web environment and discuss what lessons can be learned from this exercise and applied in more general settings .

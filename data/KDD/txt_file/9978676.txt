clustering event logs using iterative partitioning the importance of event logs , as a source of information in systems and network management can not be overemphasized . with the ever increasing size and complexity of today 's event logs , the task of analyzing event logs has become cumbersome to carry out manually . for this reason recent research has focused on the automatic analysis of these log files . in this paper we present iplom ( iterative partitioning log mining ) , a novel algorithm for the mining of clusters from event logs . through a 3-step hierarchical partitioning process iplom partitions log data into its respective clusters . in its 4th and final stage iplom produces cluster descriptions or line formats for each of the clusters produced . unlike other similar algorithms iplom is not based on the apriori algorithm and it is able to find clusters in data whether or not its instances appear frequently . evaluations show that iplom outperforms the other algorithms statistically significantly , and it is also able to achieve an average f-measure performance 78 % when the closest other algorithm achieves an f-measure performance of 10 % .

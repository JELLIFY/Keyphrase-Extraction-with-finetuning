using web browser interactions to predict task the automatic identification of a user 's task has the potential to improve information filtering systems that rely on implicit measures of interest and whose effectiveness may be dependant upon the task at hand . knowledge of a user 's current task type would allow information filtering systems to apply the most useful measures of user interest . we recently conducted a field study in which we logged all participants ' interactions with their web browsers and asked participants to categorize their web usage according to a high-level task schema . using the data collected during this study , we have conducted a preliminary exploration of the usefulness of logged web browser interactions to predict users ' tasks . the results of this initial analysis suggest that individual models of users ' web browser interactions may be useful in predicting task type .

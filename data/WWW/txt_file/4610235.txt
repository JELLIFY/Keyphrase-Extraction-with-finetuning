a link classification based approach to website topic hierarchy generation hierarchical models are commonly used to organize a website 's content . a website 's content structure can be represented by a topic hierarchy , a directed tree rooted at a website 's homepage in which the vertices and edges correspond to web pages and hyperlinks . in this work , we propose a new method for constructing the topic hierarchy of a website . we model the website 's link structure using weighted directed graph , in which the edge weights are computed using a classifier that predicts if an edge connects a pair of nodes representing a topic and a sub-topic . we then pose the problem of building the topic hierarchy as finding the shortest-path tree and directed minimum spanning tree in the weighted graph . we 've done extensive experiments using real websites and obtained very promising results .

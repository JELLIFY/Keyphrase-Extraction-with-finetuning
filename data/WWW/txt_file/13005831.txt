recommendations for the long tail by term-query graph we define a new approach to the query recommendation problem . in particular , our main goal is to design a model enabling the generation of query suggestions also for rare and previously unseen queries . in other words we are targeting queries in the long tail . the model is based on a graph having two sets of nodes : term nodes , and query nodes . the graph induces a markov chain on which a generic random walker starts from a subset of term nodes , moves along query nodes , and restarts ( with a given probability ) only from the same initial subset of term nodes . computing the stationary distribution of such a markov chain is equivalent to extracting the so-called center-piece subgraph from the graph associated with the markov chain itself . given a query , we extract its terms and we set the restart subset to this term set . therefore , we do not require a query to have been previously observed for the recommending model to be able to generate suggestions .

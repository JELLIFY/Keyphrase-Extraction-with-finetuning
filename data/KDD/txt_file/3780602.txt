mining risk patterns in medical data in this paper , we discuss a problem of finding risk patterns in medical data . we define risk patterns by a statistical metric , relative risk , which has been widely used in epidemiological research . we characterise the problem of mining risk patterns as an optimal rule discovery problem . we study an anti-monotone property for mining optimal risk pattern sets and present an algorithm to make use of the property in risk pattern discovery . the method has been applied to a real world data set to find patterns associated with an allergic event for ace inhibitors . the algorithm has generated some useful results for medical researchers .

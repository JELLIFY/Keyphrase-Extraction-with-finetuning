on-board analysis of uncalibrated data for a spacecraft at mars analyzing data on-board a spacecraft as it is collected enables several advanced spacecraft capabilities , such as prioritizing observations to make the best use of limited bandwidth and reacting to dynamic events as they happen . in this paper , we describe how we addressed the unique challenges associated with on-board mining of data as it is collected : uncalibrated data , noisy observations , and severe limitations on computational and memory resources . the goal of this effort , which falls into the emerging application area of spacecraft-based data mining , was to study three specific science phenomena on mars . following previous work that used a linear support vector machine ( svm ) on-board the earth observing 1 ( eo-1 ) spacecraft , we developed three data mining techniques for use on-board the mars odyssey spacecraft . these methods range from simple thresholding to state-of-the-art reduced-set svm technology . we tested these algorithms on archived data in a flight software testbed . we also describe a significant , serendipitous science discovery of this data mining effort : the confirmation of a water ice annulus around the north polar cap of mars . we conclude with a discussion on lessons learned in developing algorithms for use on-board a spacecraft .

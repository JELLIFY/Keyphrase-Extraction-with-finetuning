constraint-driven clustering clustering methods can be either data-driven or need-driven . data-driven methods intend to discover the true structure of the underlying data while need-driven methods aims at organizing the true structure to meet certain application requirements . thus , need-driven ( e.g. constrained ) clustering is able to find more useful and actionable clusters in applications such as energy aware sensor networks , privacy preservation , and market segmentation . however , the existing methods of constrained clustering require users to provide the number of clusters , which is often unknown in advance , but has a crucial impact on the clustering result . in this paper , we argue that a more natural way to generate actionable clusters is to let the application-specific constraints decide the number of clusters . for this purpose , we introduce a novel cluster model , constraint-driven clustering ( cdc ) , which finds an a priori unspecified number of compact clusters that satisfy all user-provided constraints . two general types of constraints are considered , i.e. minimum significance constraints and minimum variance constraints , as well as combinations of these two types . we prove the np-hardness of the cdc problem with different constraints . we propose a novel dynamic data structure , the cd-tree , which organizes data points in leaf nodes such that each leaf node approximately satisfies the cdc constraints and minimizes the objective function . based on cd-trees , we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the new clustering problem . our experimental evaluation on synthetic and real datasets demonstrates the quality of the generated clusters and the scalability of the algorithm .

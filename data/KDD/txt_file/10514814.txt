land cover change detection : a case study the study of land cover change is an important problem in the earth science domain because of its impacts on local climate , radiation balance , biogeochemistry , hydrology , and the diversity and abundance of terrestrial species . most well-known change detection techniques from statistics , signal processing and control theory are not well-suited for the massive high-dimensional spatio-temporal data sets from earth science due to limitations such as high computational complexity and the inability to take advantage of seasonality and spatio-temporal autocorrelation inherent in earth science data . in our work , we seek to address these challenges with new change detection techniques that are based on data mining approaches . specifically , in this paper we have performed a case study for a new change detection technique for the land cover change detection problem . we study land cover change in the state of california , focusing on the san francisco bay area and perform an extended study on the entire state . we also perform a comparative evaluation on forests in the entire state . these results demonstrate the utility of data mining techniques for the land cover change detection problem .

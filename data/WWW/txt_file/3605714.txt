a multi-threaded pipelined web server architecture for smp\/soc machines design of high performance web servers has become a recent research thrust to meet the increasing demand of network-based services . in this paper , we propose a new web server architecture , called multi-threaded pipelined web server , suitable for symmetric multi-processor ( smp ) or system-on-chip ( soc ) architectures . the proposed pipelined model consists of multiple thread pools , where each thread pool consists of five basic threads and two helper threads . the main advantages of the proposed model are global information sharing by the threads , minimal synchronization overhead due to less number of threads , and non-blocking i\/o operations , possible with the helper threads . we have conducted an in-depth performance analysis of the proposed server model along with four prior web server models ( multi-process ( mp ) , multi-thread ( mt ) , single-process event-driven ( sped ) and asynchronous multi-process event-driven ( amped ) ) via simulation using six web server workloads . the experiments are conducted to investigate the impact of various factors such as the memory size , disk speed and numbers of clients . the simulation results indicate that the proposed pipelined web server architecture shows the best performance across all system and workload parameters compared to the mp , mt , sped and amped models . although the mt and amped models show competitive performance with less number of processors , the advantage of the pipelined model becomes obvious as the number of processors or clients in an smp\/soc machine increases . the mp model shows the worst performance in most of the cases . the results indicate that the proposed server architecture can be used in future large-scale smp\/soc machines to boost system performance .

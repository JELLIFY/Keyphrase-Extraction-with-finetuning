semantic link based top-k join queries in p2p networks an important issue arising from peer-to-peer applications is how to accurately and efficiently retrieve a set of k best matching data objects from different sources while minimizing the number of objects that have to be accessed . this paper resolves this issue by organizing peers in a semantic link network overlay , where semantic links are established to denote the semantic relationship between peers ' data schemas . a query request will be routed to appropriate peers according to the semantic link type and a lower bound of rank function . optimization strategies are proposed to reduce the total amount of data transmitted .

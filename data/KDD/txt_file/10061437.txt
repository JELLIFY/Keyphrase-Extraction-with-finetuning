bypass rates : reducing query abandonment using negative inferences we introduce a new approach to analyzing click logs by examining both the documents that are clicked and those that are bypassed-documents returned higher in the ordering of the search results but skipped by the user . this approach complements the popular click-through rate analysis , and helps to draw negative inferences in the click logs . we formulate a natural objective that finds sets of results that are unlikely to be collectively bypassed by a typical user . this is closely related to the problem of reducing query abandonment . we analyze a greedy approach to optimizing this objective , and establish theoretical guarantees of its performance . we evaluate our approach on a large set of queries , and demonstrate that it compares favorably to the maximal marginal relevance approach on a number of metrics including mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank .

fine-grained privilege separation for web applications we present a programming model for building web applications with security properties that can be confidently verified during a security review . in our model , applications are divided into isolated , privilege-separated components , enabling rich security policies to be enforced in a way that can be checked by reviewers . in our model , the web framework enforces privilege separation and isolation of web applications by requiring the use of an object-capability language and providing interfaces that expose limited , explicitly-specified privileges to application components . this approach restricts what each component of the application can do and quarantines buggy or compromised code . it also provides a way to more safely integrate third-party , less-trusted code into a web application . we have implemented a prototype of this model based upon the java servlet framework and used it to build a webmail application . our experience with this example suggests that the approach is viable and helpful at establishing reviewable application-specific security properties .

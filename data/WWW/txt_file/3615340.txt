a comprehensive comparative study on term weighting schemes for text categorization with support vector machines term weighting scheme , which has been used to convert the documents as vectors in the term space , is a vital step in automatic text categorization . in this paper , we conducted comprehensive experiments to compare various term weighting schemes with svm on two widely-used benchmark data sets . we also presented a new term weighting scheme tf-rf to improve the term 's discriminating power . the controlled experimental results showed that this newly proposed tf-rf scheme is significantly better than other widely-used term weighting schemes . compared with schemes related with tf factor alone , the idf factor does not improve or even decrease the term 's discriminating power for text categorization .

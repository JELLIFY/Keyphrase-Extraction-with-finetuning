mining contiguous sequential patterns from web logs finding contiguous sequential patterns ( csp ) is an important problem in web usage mining . in this paper we propose a new data structure , updown tree , for csp mining . an updown tree combines suffix tree and prefix tree for efficient storage of all the sequences that contain a given item . the special structure of updown tree ensures efficient detection of csps . experiments show that updown tree improves csp mining in terms of both time and memory usage comparing to previous approaches .

xslt by example xqbe ( xquery by example , ( 1 ) ) , a visual dialect of xquery , uses hierarchical structures to express transformations between xml documents . xslt , the standard transformation language for xml , is increasingly popular among programmers and web developers for separating the application and presentation layers of web applications . however , its syntax and its rule-based execution paradigm are rather intricate , and the number of xslt experts is limited ; the availability of easier `` dialects '' could be extremely valuable and may contribute to the adoption of xml for developing data-centered web applications and services . with this motivation in mind , we adapted xqbe to serve as a visual interface for expressing xml-to-xml transformations and generate the xslt code that performs such transformations .

generative model-based clustering of directional data high dimensional directional data is becoming increasingly important in contemporary applications such as analysis of text and gene-expression data . a natural model for multi-variate directional data is provided by the von mises-fisher ( vmf ) distribution on the unit hypersphere that is analogous to the multi-variate gaussian distribution in rd. . in this paper , we propose modeling complex directional data as a mixture of vmf distributions . we derive and analyze two variants of the expectation maximization ( em ) framework for estimating the parameters of this mixture . we also propose two clustering algorithms corresponding to these variants . an interesting aspect of our methodology is that the spherical kmeans algorithm ( kmeans with cosine similarity ) can be shown to be a special case of both our algorithms . thus , modeling text data by vmf distributions lends theoretical validity to the use of cosine similarity which has been widely used by the information retrieval community . as part of experimental validation , we present results on modeling high-dimensional text and gene-expression data as a mixture of vmf distributions . the results indicate that our approach yields superior clusterings especially for difficult clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces .

an application server for the semantic web the semantic web relies on the complex interaction of several technologies involving ontologies . therefore , sophisticated semantic web applications typically comprise more than one software module . instead of coming up with proprietary solutions , developers should be able to rely on a generic infrastructure for application development in this context . we call such an infrastructure application server for the semantic web whose design and development are based on existing application servers . however , we apply and augment their underlying concepts for use in the semantic web and integrate semantic technology within the server itself . we provide a short overview of requirements and design issues of such a server and present our implementation and ongoing work kaon server .

spin : mining maximal frequent subgraphs from graph databases one fundamental challenge for mining recurring subgraphs from semi-structured data sets is the overwhelming abundance of such patterns . in large graph databases , the total number of frequent subgraphs can become too large to allow a full enumeration using reasonable computational resources . in this paper , we propose a new algorithm that mines only maximal frequent subgraphs , i.e. subgraphs that are not a part of any other frequent subgraphs . this may exponentially decrease the size of the output set in the best case ; in our experiments on practical data sets , mining maximal frequent subgraphs reduces the total number of mined patterns by two to three orders of magnitude . our method first mines all frequent trees from a general graph database and then reconstructs all maximal subgraphs from the mined trees . using two chemical structure benchmarks and a set of synthetic graph data sets , we demonstrate that , in addition to decreasing the output size , our algorithm can achieve a five-fold speed up over the current state-of-the-art subgraph mining algorithms .

galatex : a conformant implementation of the xquery full-text language we describe galatex , the first complete implementation of xquery full-text , a w3c specification that extends xpath 2.0 and xquery 1.0 with full-text search . xquery full-text provides composable full-text search primitives such as keyword search , boolean queries , and keyword-distance predicates . galatex is intended to serve as a reference implementation for xquery full-text and as a platform for addressing new research problems such as scoring full-text query results , optimizing xml queries over both structure and text , and evaluating top-k queries on scored results . galatex is an all-xquery implementation initially focused on completeness and conformance rather than on efficiency . we describe its implementation on top of galax , a complete xquery implementation .

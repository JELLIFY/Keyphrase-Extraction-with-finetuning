2lip : the step towards the web3d the world wide web allows users to create and publish a variety of resources , including multimedia ones . most of the contemporary best practices for designing web interfaces , however , do not take into account the 3d techniques . in this paper we present a novel approach for designing interactive web applications -- 2-layer interface paradigm ( 2lip ) . the background layer of the 2lip-type user interface is a 3d scene , which a user can not directly interact with . the foreground layer is html content . only taking an action on this content ( e.g. pressing a hyperlink , scrolling a page ) can affect the 3d scene . we introduce a reference implementation of 2lip : copernicus - the virtual 3d encyclopedia , which shows one of the potential paths of the evolution of wikipedia towards web 3.0 . based on the evaluation of copernicus we prove that designing web interfaces according to 2lip provides users a better browsing experience , without harming the interaction .

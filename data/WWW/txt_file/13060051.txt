open and decentralized access across location-based services users now interact with multiple location-based services ( lbs ) through a myriad set of location-aware devices and interfaces . however , current lbs tend to be centralized silos with ad-hoc apis , which limits potential for information sharing and reuse . further , lbs subscriptions and user experiences are not easily portable across devices . we propose a general architecture for providing open and decentralized access to lbs , based on tiled feeds - a restful protocol for access and interactions with lbs using feeds , and feed subscription management ( fsm ) - a generalized feed-based service management protocol . we describe two client designs , and demonstrate how they enable standardized access to lbs services , promote information sharing and mashup creation , and offer service management across various types of location-enabled devices .

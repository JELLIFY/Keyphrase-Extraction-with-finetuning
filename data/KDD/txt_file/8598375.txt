clustering seasonality patterns in the presence of errors clustering is a very well studied problem that attempts to group similar data points . most traditional clustering algorithms assume that the data is provided without measurement error . often , however , real world data sets have such errors and one can obtain estimates of these errors . we present a clustering method that incorporates information contained in these error estimates . we present a new distance function that is based on the distribution of errors in data . using a gaussian model for errors , the distance function follows a chi-square distribution and is easy to compute . this distance function is used in hierarchical clustering to discover meaningful clusters . the distance function is scale-invariant so that clustering results are independent of units of measuring data . in the special case when the error distribution is the same for each attribute of data points , the rank order of pair-wise distances is the same for our distance function and the euclidean distance function . the clustering method is applied to the seasonality estimation problem and experimental results are presented for the retail industry data as well as for simulated data , where it outperforms classical clustering methods .

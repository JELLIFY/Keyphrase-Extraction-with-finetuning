mining coherent gene clusters from gene-sample-time microarray data extensive studies have shown that mining microarray data sets is important in bioinformatics research and biomedical applications . in this paper , we explore a novel type of gene-sample-time microarray data sets , which records the expression levels of various genes under a set of samples during a series of time points . in particular , we propose the mining of coherent gene clusters from such data sets . each cluster contains a subset of genes and a subset of samples such that the genes are coherent on the samples along the time series . the coherent gene clusters may identify the samples corresponding to some phenotypes ( e.g. , diseases ) , and suggest the candidate genes correlated to the phenotypes . we present two efficient algorithms , namely the sample-gene search and the gene-sample search , to mine the complete set of coherent gene clusters . we empirically evaluate the performance of our approaches on both a real microarray data set and synthetic data sets . the test results have shown that our approaches are both efficient and effective to find meaningful coherent gene clusters .

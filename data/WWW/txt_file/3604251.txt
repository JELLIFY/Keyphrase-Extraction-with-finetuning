identifying link farm spam pages with the increasing importance of search in guiding today 's web traffic , more and more effort has been spent to create search engine spam . since link analysis is one of the most important factors in current commercial search engines ' ranking systems , new kinds of spam aiming at links have appeared . building link farms is one technique that can deteriorate link-based ranking algorithms . in this paper , we present algorithms for detecting these link farms automatically by first generating a seed set based on the common link set between incoming and outgoing links of web pages and then expanding it . links between identified pages are re-weighted , providing a modified web graph to use in ranking page importance . experimental results show that we can identify most link farm spam pages and the final ranking results are improved for almost all tested queries .

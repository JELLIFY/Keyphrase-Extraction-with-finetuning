extending the compatibility notion for abstract ws-bpel processes ws-bpel defines a standard for executable processes . executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an it infrastructure . the ws-bpel specification also introduces the concept of abstract processes : in contrast to their executable siblings , abstract processes are not executable and can have parts where business logic is disguised . nevertheless , the ws-bpel specification introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-specified abstract process and a fully specified executable one . basically , this compatibility notion defines a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by profiles . so far , there exist two of such profiles : the abstract process profile for observable behavior and the abstract process profile for templates . none of these profiles defines a concept of behavioral equivalence . therefore , both profiles are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one . in this paper , we propose a novel profile that extends the existing abstract process profile for observable behavior by defining a behavioral relationship . we also show that our novel profile allows for more flexibility when deciding whether an executable and an abstract process are compatible .

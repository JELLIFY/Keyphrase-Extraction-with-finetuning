performing grouping and aggregate functions in xml queries since more and more business data are represented in xml format , there is a compelling need of supporting analytical operations in xml queries . particularly , the latest version of xquery proposed by w3c , xquery 1.1 , introduces a new construct to explicitly express grouping operation in flwor expression . existing works in xml query processing mainly focus on physically matching query structure over xml document . given the explicit grouping operation in a query , how to efficiently compute grouping and aggregate functions over xml document is not well studied yet . in this paper , we extend our previous xml query processing algorithm , vert , to efficiently perform grouping and aggregate function in queries . the main technique of our approach is introducing relational tables to index values . query pattern matching and aggregation computing are both conducted with table indices . we also propose two semantic optimizations to further improve the query performance . finally we present experimental results to validate the efficiency of our approach , over other existing approaches .

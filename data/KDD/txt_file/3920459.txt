clustering pair-wise dissimilarity data into partially ordered sets ontologies represent data relationships as hierarchies of possibly overlapping classes . ontologies are closely related to clustering hierarchies , and in this article we explore this relationship in depth . in particular , we examine the space of ontologies that can be generated by pairwise dissimilarity matrices . we demonstrate that classical clustering algorithms , which take dissimilarity matrices as inputs , do not incorporate all available information . in fact , only special types of dissimilarity matrices can be exactly preserved by previous clustering methods . we model ontologies as a partially ordered set ( poset ) over the subset relation . in this paper , we propose a new clustering algorithm , that generates a partially ordered set of clusters from a dissimilarity matrix .

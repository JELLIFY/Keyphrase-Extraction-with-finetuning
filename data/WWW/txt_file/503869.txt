sctp : an innovative transport layer protocol for the web we propose using the stream control transmission protocol ( sctp ) , a recent ietf transport layer protocol , for reliable web transport . although tcp has traditionally been used , we argue that sctp better matches the needs of http-based network applications . this position paper discusses sctp features that address : ( i ) head-of-line blocking within a single tcp connection , ( ii ) vulnerability to network failures , and ( iii ) vulnerability to denial-of-service syn attacks . we discuss our experience in modifying the apache server and the firefox browser to benefit from sctp , and demonstrate our http over sctp design via simple experiments . we also discuss the benefits of using sctp in other web domains through two example scenarios ? multiplexing user requests , and multiplexing resource access . finally , we highlight several sctp features that will be valuable to the design and implementation of current http-based client-server applications .

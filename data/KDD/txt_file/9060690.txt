anomaly pattern detection in categorical datasets we propose a new method for detecting patterns of anomalies in categorical datasets . we assume that anomalies are generated by some underlying process which affects only a particular subset of the data . our method consists of two steps : we first use a `` local anomaly detector '' to identify individual records with anomalous attribute values , and then detect patterns where the number of anomalous records is higher than expected . given the set of anomalies flagged by the local anomaly detector , we search over all subsets of the data defined by any set of fixed values of a subset of the attributes , in order to detect self-similar patterns of anomalies . we wish to detect any such subset of the test data which displays a significant increase in anomalous activity as compared to the normal behavior of the system ( as indicated by the training data ) . we perform significance testing to determine if the number of anomalies in any subset of the test data is significantly higher than expected , and propose an efficient algorithm to perform this test over all such subsets of the data . we show that this algorithm is able to accurately detect anomalous patterns in real-world hospital , container shipping and network intrusion data .

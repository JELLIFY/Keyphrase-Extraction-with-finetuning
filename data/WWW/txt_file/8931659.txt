a diagrammatic inference system for the web we developed a diagrammatic inference system for the world wide web . our system enables the creation of diagrams such that the information contained in them can be searched and inference can be performed on it . we developed an xmlschema for bar , line , and pie charts . based on it , we developed software that transforms a corresponding xml file into an svg image , which in turn is rendered by the client as an image . additionally , we developed a search engine which enables a user to find information explicitly contained in the xml file , and as such in the image . furthermore , we developed an inference engine which enables a user to locate information that is implicitly contained in the image .

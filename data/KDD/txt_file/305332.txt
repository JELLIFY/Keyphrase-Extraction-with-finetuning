carpenter : finding closed patterns in long biological datasets the growth of bioinformatics has resulted in datasets with new characteristics . these datasets typically contain a large number of columns and a small number of rows . for example , many gene expression datasets may contain 10,000-100 ,000 columns but only 100-1000 rows . such datasets pose a great challenge for existing ( closed ) frequent pattern discovery algorithms , since they have an exponential dependence on the average row length . in this paper , we describe a new algorithm called carpenter that is specially designed to handle datasets having a large number of attributes and relatively small number of rows . several experiments on real bioinformatics datasets show that carpenter is orders of magnitude better than previous closed pattern mining algorithms like closet and charm .

automatically refining the wikipedia infobox ontology the combined efforts of human volunteers have recently extracted numerous facts from wikipedia , storing them as machine-harvestable object-attribute-value triples in wikipedia infoboxes . machine learning systems , such as kylin , use these infoboxes as training data , accurately extracting even more semantic knowledge from natural language text . but in order to realize the full power of this information , it must be situated in a cleanly-structured ontology . this paper introduces kog , an autonomous system for refining wikipedia 's infobox-class ontology towards this end . we cast the problem of ontology refinement as a machine learning problem and solve it using both svms and a more powerful joint-inference approach expressed in markov logic networks . we present experiments demonstrating the superiority of the joint-inference approach and evaluating other aspects of our system . using these techniques , we build a rich ontology , integrating wikipedia 's infobox-class schemata with wordnet . we demonstrate how the resulting ontology may be used to enhance wikipedia with improved query processing and other features .

vertex collocation profiles : subgraph counting for link analysis and prediction we introduce the concept of a vertex collocation profile ( vcp ) for the purpose of topological link analysis and prediction . vcps provide nearly complete information about the surrounding local structure of embedded vertex pairs . the vcp approach offers a new tool for domain experts to understand the underlying growth mechanisms in their networks and to analyze link formation mechanisms in the appropriate sociological , biological , physical , or other context . the same resolution that gives vcp its analytical power also enables it to perform well when used in supervised models to discriminate potential new links . we first develop the theory , mathematics , and algorithms underlying vcps . then we demonstrate vcp methods performing link prediction competitively with unsupervised and supervised methods across several different network families . we conclude with timing results that introduce the comparative performance of several existing algorithms and the practicability of vcp computations on large networks .

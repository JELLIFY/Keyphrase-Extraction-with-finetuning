multi-objective ranking of comments on web with the explosion of information on any topic , the need for ranking is becoming very critical . ranking typically depends on several aspects . products , for example , have several aspects like price , recency , rating , etc. . product ranking has to bring the `` best '' product which is recent and highly rated . hence ranking has to satisfy multiple objectives . in this paper , we explore multi-objective ranking of comments using hodge decomposition . while hodge decomposition produces a globally consistent ranking , a globally inconsistent component is also present . we propose an active learning strategy for the reduction of this component . finally , we develop techniques for online hodge decomposition . we experimentally validate the ideas presented in this paper .

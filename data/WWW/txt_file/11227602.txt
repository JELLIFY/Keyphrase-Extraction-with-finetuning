modeling relationship strength in online social networks previous work analyzing social networks has mainly focused on binary friendship relations . however , in online social networks the low cost of link formation can lead to networks with heterogeneous relationship strengths ( e.g. , acquaintances and best friends mixed together ) . in this case , the binary friendship indicator provides only a coarse representation of relationship information . in this work , we develop an unsupervised model to estimate relationship strength from interaction activity ( e.g. , communication , tagging ) and user similarity . more specifically , we formulate a link-based latent variable model , along with a coordinate ascent optimization procedure for the inference . we evaluate our approach on real-world data from facebook and linkedin , showing that the estimated link weights result in higher autocorrelation and lead to improved classification accuracy .

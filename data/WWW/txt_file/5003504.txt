high-performance spatial indexing for location-based services much attention has been accorded to location-based services and location tracking , a necessary component in active , trigger-based lbs applications . tracking the location of a large population of moving objects requires very high update and query performance of the underlying spatial index . in this paper we investigate the performance and scalability of three main-memory based spatial indexing methods under dynamic update and query loads : an r-tree , a zb-tree , and an array\/hashtable method . by leveraging the locus performance evaluation testbed and the city simulator dynamic spatial data generator , we are able to demonstrate the scalability of these methods and determine the maximum population size supported by each method , a useful parameter for capacity planning by wireless carriers .

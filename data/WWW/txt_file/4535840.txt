access control enforcement for conversation-based web services service oriented computing is emerging as the main approach to build distributed enterprise applications on the web . the widespread use of web services is hindered by the lack of adequate security and privacy support . in this paper , we present a novel framework for enforcing access control in conversation-based web services . our approach takes into account the conversational nature of web services . this is in contrast with existing approaches to access control enforcement that assume a web service as a set of independent operations . furthermore , our approach achieves a tradeoff between the need to protect web service 's access control policies and the need to disclose to clients the portion of access control policies related to the conversations they are interested in . this is important to avoid situations where the client can not progress in the conversation due to the lack of required security requirements . we introduce the concept of k-trustworthiness that defines the conversations for which a client can provide credentials maximizing the likelihood that it will eventually hit a final state .

efficiently evaluating graph constraints in content-based publish\/subscribe we introduce the problem of evaluating graph constraints in content-based publish\/subscribe ( pub\/sub ) systems . this problem formulation extends traditional content-based pub\/sub systems in the following manner : publishers and subscribers are connected via a ( logical ) directed graph g with node and edge constraints , which limits the set of valid paths between them . such graph constraints can be used to model a web advertising exchange ( where there may be restrictions on how advertising networks can connect advertisers and publishers ) and content delivery problems in social networks ( where there may be restrictions on how information can be shared via the social graph ) . in this context , we develop efficient algorithms for evaluating graph constraints over arbitrary directed graphs g. we also present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed algorithms using a realistic dataset from yahoo ! 's web advertising exchange .

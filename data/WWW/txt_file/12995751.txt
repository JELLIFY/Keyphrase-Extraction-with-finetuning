influence and passivity in social media the ever-increasing amount of information flowing through social media forces the members of these networks to compete for attention and influence by relying on other people to spread their message . a large study of information propagation within twitter reveals that the majority of users act as passive information consumers and do not forward the content to the network . therefore , in order for individuals to become influential they must not only obtain attention and thus be popular , but also overcome user passivity . we propose an algorithm that determines the influence and passivity of users based on their information forwarding activity . an evaluation performed with a 2.5 million user dataset shows that our influence measure is a good predictor of url clicks , outperforming several other measures that do not explicitly take user passivity into account . we demonstrate that high popularity does not necessarily imply high influence and vice-versa .

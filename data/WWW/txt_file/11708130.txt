pragmatic evaluation of folksonomies recently , a number of algorithms have been proposed to obtain hierarchical structures - so-called folksonomies - from social tagging data . work on these algorithms is in part driven by a belief that folksonomies are useful for tasks such as : ( a ) navigating social tagging systems and ( b ) acquiring semantic relationships between tags . while the promises and pitfalls of the latter have been studied to some extent , we know very little about the extent to which folksonomies are pragmatically useful for navigating social tagging systems . this paper sets out to address this gap by presenting and applying a pragmatic framework for evaluating folksonomies . we model exploratory navigation of a tagging system as decentralized search on a network of tags . evaluation is based on the fact that the performance of a decentralized search algorithm depends on the quality of the background knowledge used . the key idea of our approach is to use hierarchical structures learned by folksonomy algorithm as background knowledge for decentralized search . utilizing decentralized search on tag networks in combination with different folksonomies as hierarchical background knowledge allows us to evaluate navigational tasks in social tagging systems . our experiments with four state-of-the-art folksonomy algorithms on five different social tagging datasets reveal that existing folksonomy algorithms exhibit significant , previously undiscovered , differences with regard to their utility for navigation . our results are relevant for engineers aiming to improve navigability of social tagging systems and for scientists aiming to evaluate different folksonomy algorithms from a pragmatic perspective .

we know who you followed last summer : inferring social link creation times in twitter understanding a network 's temporal evolution appears to require multiple observations of the graph over time . these often expensive repeated crawls are only able to answer questions about what happened from observation to observation , and not what happened before or between network snapshots . contrary to this picture , we propose a method for twitter 's social network that takes a single static snapshot of network edges and user account creation times to accurately infer when these edges were formed . this method can be exact in theory , and we demonstrate empirically for a large subset of twitter relationships that it is accurate to within a few hours in practice . we study users who have a very large number of edges or who are recommended by twitter . we examine the graph formed by these nearly 1,800 twitter celebrities and their 862 million edges in detail , showing that a single static snapshot can give novel insights about twitter 's evolution . we conclude from this analysis that real-world events and changes to twitter 's interface for recommending users strongly influence network growth .

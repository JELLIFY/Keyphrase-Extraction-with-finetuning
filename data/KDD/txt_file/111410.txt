discovering informative content blocks from web documents in this paper , we propose a new approach to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents ( or web pages ) of a web site . our system , infodiscoverer , first partitions a page into several content blocks according to html tag ( table ) in a web page . based on the occurrence of the features ( terms ) in the set of pages , it calculates entropy value of each feature . according to the entropy value of each feature in a content block , the entropy value of the block is defined . by analyzing the information measure , we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant . informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page , whereas redundant content blocks are common parts . based on the answer set generated from 13 manually tagged news web sites with a total of 26,518 web pages , experiments show that both recall and precision rates are greater than 0.956 . that is , using the approach , informative blocks ( news articles ) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements , banners , navigation panels , news categories , etc. . by adopting infodiscoverer as the preprocessor of information retrieval and extraction applications , the retrieval and extracting precision will be increased , and the indexing size and extracting complexity will also be reduced .

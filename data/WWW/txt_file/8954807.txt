multispace information visualization framework for the intercomparison of data sets retrieved from web services we introduce a new visualization framework for the intercomparison of more than one data set retrieved from web services . in our framework , we use more than one visualization space simultaneously , each of which visualizes a single data set retrieved from the web service . for this purpose , we provide a new 3d component for accessing web services , and provide a 3d space component , in which data set retrieved from the web service is visualized . moreover , our framework provides users with various operations applicable to these space components , i.e. , union , intersection , set-difference , cross-product , selection , projection , and joins .

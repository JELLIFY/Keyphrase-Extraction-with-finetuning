interestingness of frequent itemsets using bayesian networks as background knowledge the paper presents a method for pruning frequent itemsets based on background knowledge represented by a bayesian network . the interestingness of an itemset is defined as the absolute difference between its support estimated from data and from the bayesian network . efficient algorithms are presented for finding interestingness of a collection of frequent itemsets , and for finding all attribute sets with a given minimum interestingness . practical usefulness of the algorithms and their efficiency have been verified experimentally .

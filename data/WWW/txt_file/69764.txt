on the bursty evolution of blogspace we propose two new tools to address the evolution of hyperlinked corpora . first , we define time graphs to extend the traditional notion of an evolving directed graph , capturing link creation as a point phenomenon in time . second , we develop definitions and algorithms for time-dense community tracking , to crystallize the notion of community evolution . we develop these tools in the context of blogspace , the space of weblogs ( or blogs ) . our study involves approximately 750k links among 25k blogs . we create a time graph on these blogs by an automatic analysis of their internal time stamps . we then study the evolution of connected component structure and microscopic community structure in this time graph . we show that blogspace underwent a transition behavior around the end of 2001 , and has been rapidly expanding over the past year , not just in metrics of scale , but also in metrics of community structure and connectedness . this expansion shows no sign of abating , although measures of connectedness must plateau within two years . by randomizing link destinations in blogspace , but retaining sources and timestamps , we introduce a concept of randomized blogspace . herein , we observe similar evolution of a giant component , but no corresponding increase in community structure . having demonstrated the formation of micro-communities over time , we then turn to the ongoing activity within active communities . we extend recent work of kleinberg ( 11 ) to discover dense periods of `` bursty '' intra-community link creation .

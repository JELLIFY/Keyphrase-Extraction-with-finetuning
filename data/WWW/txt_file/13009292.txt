an xpath-based discourse analysis module for spoken dialogue systems this paper describes an xpath-based discourse analysis module for spoken dialogue systems that allows the dialogue author to easily manipulate and query both the user input 's semantic representation and the dialogue context using a simple and compact formalism . we show that , in managing the human-machine interaction , the discourse context and the dialogue history are effectively represented as document object model ( dom ) structures . dom defines interfaces that dialogue scripts can use to dynamically access and update the content , the structure and the style of the documents . in general , this approach applies also to richer multimedia and multimodal interactions where the interpretation of the user input depends on a combination of input modalitie .

get another label ? improving data quality and data mining using multiple , noisy labelers this paper addresses the repeated acquisition of labels for data items when the labeling is imperfect . we examine the improvement ( or lack thereof ) in data quality via repeated labeling , and focus especially on the improvement of training labels for supervised induction . with the outsourcing of small tasks becoming easier , for example via rent-a-coder or amazon 's mechanical turk , it often is possible to obtain less-than-expert labeling at low cost . with low-cost labeling , preparing the unlabeled part of the data can become considerably more expensive than labeling . we present repeated-labeling strategies of increasing complexity , and show several main results . ( i ) repeated-labeling can improve label quality and model quality , but not always . ( ii ) when labels are noisy , repeated labeling can be preferable to single labeling even in the traditional setting where labels are not particularly cheap . ( iii ) as soon as the cost of processing the unlabeled data is not free , even the simple strategy of labeling everything multiple times can give considerable advantage . ( iv ) repeatedly labeling a carefully chosen set of points is generally preferable , and we present a robust technique that combines different notions of uncertainty to select data points for which quality should be improved . the bottom line : the results show clearly that when labeling is not perfect , selective acquisition of multiple labels is a strategy that data miners should have in their repertoire ; for certain label-quality\/cost regimes , the benefit is substantial .

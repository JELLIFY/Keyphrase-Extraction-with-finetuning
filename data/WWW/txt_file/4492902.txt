using annotations in enterprise search a major difference between corporate intranets and the internet is that in intranets the barrier for users to create web pages is much higher . this limits the amount and quality of anchor text , one of the major factors used by internet search engines , making intranet search more difficult . the social phenomenon at play also means that spam is relatively rare . both on the internet and in intranets , users are often willing to cooperate with the search engine in improving the search experience . these characteristics naturally lead to considering using user feedback to improve search quality in intranets . in this paper we show how a particular form of feedback , namely user annotations , can be used to improve the quality of intranet search . an annotation is a short description of the contents of a web page , which can be considered a substitute for anchor text . we propose two ways to obtain user annotations , using explicit and implicit feedback , and show how they can be integrated into a search engine . preliminary experiments on the ibm intranet demonstrate that using annotations improves the search quality .

template detection via data mining and its applications we formulate and propose the template detection problem , and suggest a practical solution for it based on counting frequent item sets . we show that the use of templates is pervasive on the web . we describe three principles , which characterize the assumptions made by hypertext information retrieval ( ir ) and data mining ( dm ) systems , and show that templates are a major source of violation of these principles . as a consequence , basic `` pure '' implementations of simple search algorithms coupled with template detection and elimination show surprising increases in precision at all levels of recall .

mining closed episodes with simultaneous events sequential pattern discovery is a well-studied field in data mining . episodes are sequential patterns describing events that often occur in the vicinity of each other . episodes can impose restrictions to the order of the events , which makes them a versatile technique for describing complex patterns in the sequence . most of the research on episodes deals with special cases such as serial , parallel , and injective episodes , while discovering general episodes is understudied . in this paper we extend the definition of an episode in order to be able to represent cases where events often occur simultaneously . we present an efficient and novel miner for discovering frequent and closed general episodes . such a task presents unique challenges . firstly , we can not define closure based on frequency . we solve this by computing a more conservative closure that we use to reduce the search space and discover the closed episodes as a postprocessing step . secondly , episodes are traditionally presented as directed acyclic graphs . we argue that this representation has drawbacks leading to redundancy in the output . we solve these drawbacks by defining a subset relationship in such a way that allows us to remove the redundant episodes . we demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm and the need for using closed episodes empirically on synthetic and real-world datasets .

parallel mining of closed sequential patterns discovery of sequential patterns is an essential data mining task with broad applications . among several variations of sequential patterns , closed sequential pattern is the most useful one since it retains all the information of the complete pattern set but is often much more compact than it . unfortunately , there is no parallel closed sequential pattern mining method proposed yet . in this paper we develop an algorithm , called par-csp ( parallel closed sequential pattern mining ) , to conduct parallel mining of closed sequential patterns on a distributed memory system . par-csp partitions the work among the processors by exploiting the divide-and-conquer property so that the overhead of interprocessor communication is minimized . par-csp applies dynamic scheduling to avoid processor idling . moreover , it employs a technique , called selective sampling to address the load imbalance problem . we implement par-csp using mpi on a 64-node linux cluster . our experimental results show that par-csp attains good parallelization efficiencies on various input datasets .

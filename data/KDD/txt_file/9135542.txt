mobile call graphs : beyond power-law and lognormal distributions we analyze a massive social network , gathered from the records of a large mobile phone operator , with more than a million users and tens of millions of calls . we examine the distributions of the number of phone calls per customer ; the total talk minutes per customer ; and the distinct number of calling partners per customer . we find that these distributions are skewed , and that they significantly deviate from what would be expected by power-law and lognormal distributions . to analyze our observed distributions ( of number of calls , distinct call partners , and total talk time ) , we propose powertrack , a method which fits a lesser known but more suitable distribution , namely the double pareto lognormal ( dpln ) distribution , to our data and track its parameters over time . using powertrack , we find that our graph changes over time in a way consistent with a generative process that naturally results in the dpln distributions we observe . furthermore , we show that this generative process lends itself to a natural and appealing social wealth interpretation in the context of social networks such as ours . we discuss the application of those results to our model and to forecasting .

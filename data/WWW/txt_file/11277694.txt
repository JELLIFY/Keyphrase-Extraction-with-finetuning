linkrec : a unified framework for link recommendation with user attributes and graph structure with the phenomenal success of networking sites ( e.g. , facebook , twitter and linkedin ) , social networks have drawn substantial attention . on online social networking sites , link recommendation is a critical task that not only helps improve user experience but also plays an essential role in network growth . in this paper we propose several link recommendation criteria , based on both user attributes and graph structure . to discover the candidates that satisfy these criteria , link relevance is estimated using a random walk algorithm on an augmented social graph with both attribute and structure information . the global and local influence of the attributes is leveraged in the framework as well . besides link recommendation , our framework can also rank attributes in a social network . experiments on dblp and imdb data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods based on network structure and node attribute information for link recommendation .

structured entity identification and document categorization : two tasks with one joint model traditionally , research in identifying structured entities in documents has proceeded independently of document categorization research . in this paper , we observe that these two tasks have much to gain from each other . apart from direct references to entities in a database , such as names of person entities , documents often also contain words that are correlated with discriminative entity attributes , such age-group and income-level of persons . this happens naturally in many enterprise domains such as crm , banking , etc. . then , entity identification , which is typically vulnerable against noise and incompleteness in direct references to entities in documents , can benefit from document categorization with respect to such attributes . in return , entity identification enables documents to be categorized according to different label-sets arising from entity attributes without requiring any supervision . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic generative model for joint entity identification and document categorization . we show how the parameters of the model can be estimated using an em algorithm in an unsupervised fashion . using extensive experiments over real and semi-synthetic data , we demonstrate that the two tasks can benefit immensely from each other when performed jointly using the proposed model .

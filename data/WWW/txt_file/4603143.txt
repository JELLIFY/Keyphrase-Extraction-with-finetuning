selective hypertext induced topic search we address the problem of answering broad-topic queries on the world wide web . we present a link based analysis algorithm selhits , which is an improvement over kleinberg 's hits ( 2 ) algorithm . we introduce the concept of virtual links to exploit the latent information in the hyperlinked environment . we propose a novel approach to calculate hub and authority values . we also present a selective expansion method which avoids topic drift and provides results consistent with only one interpretation of the query , even if the query is ambiguous . initial experimental evaluation and user feedback show that our algorithm indeed distills the most important and relevant pages for broad-topic queries . we also infer that there exists a uniform notion of quality of search results within users .

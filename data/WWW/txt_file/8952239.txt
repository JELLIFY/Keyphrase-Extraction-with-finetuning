applying navoptim to minimize navigational effort a major factor in the effectiveness of the interaction which users have with web applications is the ease with which they can locate information and functionality which they are seeking . effective design is however complicated by the multiple design purposes and diverse users which web applications typically support . in this paper we describe a navigational design method aimed at optimising designs through minimizing navigational entropy . the approach uses a theoretical navigational depth for the various information and service components to moderate a nested hierarchical clustering of the content .

center-piece subgraphs : problem definition and fast solutions given q nodes in a social network ( say , authorship network ) , how can we find the node\/author that is the center-piece , and has direct or indirect connections to all , or most of them ? for example , this node could be the common advisor , or someone who started the research area that the q nodes belong to . isomorphic scenarios appear in law enforcement ( find the master-mind criminal , connected to all current suspects ) , gene regulatory networks ( find the protein that participates in pathways with all or most of the given q proteins ) , viral marketing and many more . connection subgraphs is an important first step , handling the case of q = 2 query nodes . then , the connection subgraph algorithm finds the b intermediate nodes , that provide a good connection between the two original query nodes . here we generalize the challenge in multiple dimensions : first , we allow more than two query nodes . second , we allow a whole family of queries , ranging from ` or ' to ` and ' , with ` softand ' in-between . finally , we design and compare a fast approximation , and study the quality\/speed trade-off . we also present experiments on the dblp dataset . the experiments confirm that our proposed method naturally deals with multi-source queries and that the resulting subgraphs agree with our intuition . wall-clock timing results on the dblp dataset show that our proposed approximation achieve good accuracy for about 6:1 speedup .

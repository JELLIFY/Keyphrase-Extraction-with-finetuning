hypergraph spectral learning for multi-label classification a hypergraph is a generalization of the traditional graph in which the edges are arbitrary non-empty subsets of the vertex set . it has been applied successfully to capture high-order relations in various domains . in this paper , we propose a hypergraph spectral learning formulation for multi-label classification , where a hypergraph is constructed to exploit the correlation information among different labels . we show that the proposed formulation leads to an eigenvalue problem , which may be computationally expensive especially for large-scale problems . to reduce the computational cost , we propose an approximate formulation , which is shown to be equivalent to a least squares problem under a mild condition . based on the approximate formulation , efficient algorithms for solving least squares problems can be applied to scale the formulation to very large data sets . in addition , existing regularization techniques for least squares can be incorporated into the model for improved generalization performance . we have conducted experiments using large-scale benchmark data sets , and experimental results show that the proposed hypergraph spectral learning formulation is effective in capturing the high-order relations in multi-label problems . results also indicate that the approximate formulation is much more efficient than the original one , while keeping competitive classification performance .

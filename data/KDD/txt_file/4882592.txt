cross channel optimized marketing by reinforcement learning the issues of cross channel integration and customer life time value modeling are two of the most important topics surrounding customer relationship management ( crm ) today . in the present paper , we describe and evaluate a novel solution that treats these two important issues in a unified framework of markov decision processes ( mdp ) . in particular , we report on the results of a joint project between ibm research and saks fifth avenue to investigate the applicability of this technology to real world problems . the business problem we use as a testbed for our evaluation is that of optimizing direct mail campaign mailings for maximization of profits in the store channel . we identify a problem common to cross-channel crm , which we call the cross-channel challenge , due to the lack of explicit linking between the marketing actions taken in one channel and the customer responses obtained in another . we provide a solution for this problem based on old and new techniques in reinforcement learning . our in-laboratory experimental evaluation using actual customer interaction data show that as much as 7 to 8 per cent increase in the store profits can be expected , by employing a mailing policy automatically generated by our methodology . these results confirm that our approach is valid in dealing with the cross channel crm scenarios in the real world .

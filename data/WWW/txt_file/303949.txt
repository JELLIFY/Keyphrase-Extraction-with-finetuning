an incremental xslt transformation processor for xml document manipulation in this paper , we present an incremental transformation framework called incxslt . this framework has been experimented for the xslt language defined at the world wide web consortium . for the currently available tools , designing the xml content and the transformation sheets is an inefficient , a tedious and an error prone experience . incremental transformation processors such as incxslt represent a better alternative to help in the design of both the content and the transformation sheets . we believe that such frameworks are a first step toward fully interactive transformation-based authoring environments .

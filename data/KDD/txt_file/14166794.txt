mime : a framework for interactive visual pattern mining we present a framework for interactive visual pattern mining . our system enables the user to browse through the data and patterns easily and intuitively , using a toolbox consisting of interestingness measures , mining algorithms and post-processing algorithms to assist in identifying interesting patterns . by mining interactively , we enable the user to combine their subjective interestingness measure and background knowledge with a wide variety of objective measures to easily and quickly mine the most important and interesting patterns . basically , we enable the user to become an essential part of the mining algorithm . our demo currently applies to mining interesting itemsets and association rules , and its extension to episodes and decision trees is ongoing .

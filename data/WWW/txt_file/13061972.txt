traffic characterization and internet usage in rural africa while internet connectivity has reached a significant part of the world 's population , those living in rural areas of the developing world are still largely disconnected . recent efforts have provided internet connectivity to a growing number of remote locations , yet internet traffic demands cause many of these networks to fail to deliver basic quality of service needed for simple applications . for an in-depth investigation of the problem , we gather and analyze network traces from a rural wireless network in macha , zambia . we supplement our analysis with on-site interviews from macha , zambia and dwesa , south africa , another rural community that hosts a local wireless network . the results reveal that internet traffic in rural africa differs significantly from the developed world . we observe dominance of web-based traffic , as opposed to peer-to-peer traffic common in urban areas . application-wise , online social networks are the most popular , while the majority of bandwidth is consumed by large operating system updates . our analysis also uncovers numerous network anomalies , such as significant malware traffic . finally , we find a strong feedback loop between network performance and user behavior . based on our findings , we conclude with a discussion of new directions in network design that take into account both technical and social factors .

scheduling web requests in broadcast environments on-demand broadcast has been supported in the internet to enhance system scalability . unfortunately , most of existing on-demand scheduling algorithms did not consider the time constraints associated with web requests . this paper proposes a novel scheduling algorithm , called slack inverse number of requests ( sin ) , that takes into account the urgency and productivity of serving pending requests . trace-driven experiments demonstrate that sin significantly out performs existing algorithms over a wide range of workloads .

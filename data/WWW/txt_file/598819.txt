popular web hot spots identification and visualization this work aims a two-fold contribution : it presents a software to analyze logfiles and visualize popular web hot spots and , additionally , presents an algorithm to use this information in order to identify subsets of the website that display large access patterns . such information is extremely valuable to the site maintainer , since it indicates points that may need content intervention or\/and site graph restructuring . experimental validation verified that the visualization tool , when coupled with algorithms that infer frequent traversal patterns , is both effective in indicating popular hot spots and efficient in doing so by using graph-based representations of popular traversals .

detection of emerging space-time clusters we propose a new class of spatio-temporal cluster detection methods designed for the rapid detection of emerging space-time clusters . we focus on the motivating application of prospective disease surveillance : detecting space-time clusters of disease cases resulting from an emerging disease outbreak . automatic , real-time detection of outbreaks can enable rapid epidemiological response , potentially reducing rates of morbidity and mortality . building on the prior work on spatial and space-time scan statistics , our methods combine time series analysis ( to determine how many cases we expect to observe for a given spatial region in a given time interval ) with new `` emerging cluster '' space-time scan statistics ( to decide whether an observed increase in cases in a region is significant ) , enabling fast and accurate detection of emerging outbreaks . we evaluate these methods on two types of simulated outbreaks : aerosol release of inhalational anthrax ( e.g. from a bioterrorist attack ) and floo ( `` fictional linear onset outbreak '' ) , injected into actual baseline data ( emergency department records and over-the-counter drug sales data from allegheny county ) . we demonstrate that our methods are successful in rapidly detecting both outbreak types while keeping the number of false positives low , and show that our new `` emerging cluster '' scan statistics consistently outperform the standard `` persistent cluster '' scan statistics approach .

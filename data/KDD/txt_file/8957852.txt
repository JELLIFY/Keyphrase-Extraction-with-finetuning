similarity analysis on government regulations government regulations are semi-structured text documents that are often voluminous , heavily cross-referenced between provisions and even ambiguous . multiple sources of regulations lead to difficulties in both understanding and complying with all applicable codes . in this work , we propose a framework for regulation management and similarity analysis . an online repository for legal documents is created with the help of text mining tool , and users can access regulatory documents either through the natural hierarchy of provisions or from a taxonomy generated by knowledge engineers based on concepts . our similarity analysis core identifies relevant provisions and brings them to the user 's attention , and this is performed by utilizing both the hierarchical and referential structures of regulations to provide a better comparison between provisions . preliminary results show that our system reveals hidden similarities that are not apparent between provisions based on node content comparisons .

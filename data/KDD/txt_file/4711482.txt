generation of synthetic data sets for evaluating the accuracy of knowledge discovery systems information discovery and analysis systems ( idas ) are designed to correlate multiple sources of data and use data mining techniques to identify potential significant events . application domains for idas are numerous and include the emerging area of homeland security . developing test cases for an idas requires background data sets into which hypothetical future scenarios can be overlaid . the idas can then be measured in terms of false positive and false negative error rates . obtaining the test data sets can be an obstacle due to both privacy issues and also the time and cost associated with collecting a diverse set of data sources . in this paper , we give an overview of the design and architecture of an idas data set generator ( idsg ) that enables a fast and comprehensive test of an idas . the idsg generates data using statistical and rule-based algorithms and also semantic graphs that represent interdependencies between attributes . a credit card transaction application is used to illustrate the approach .

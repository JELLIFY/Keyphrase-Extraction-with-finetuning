deriving knowledge from figures for digital libraries figures in digital documents contain important information . current digital libraries do not summarize and index information available within figures for document retrieval . we present our system on automatic categorization of figures and extraction of data from 2-d plots . a machine-learning based method is used to categorize figures into a set of predefined types based on image features . an automated algorithm is designed to extract data values from solid line curves in 2-d plots . the semantic type of figures and extracted data values from 2-d plots can be integrated with textual information within documents to provide more effective document retrieval services for digital library users . experimental evaluation has demonstrated that our system can produce results suitable for real-world use .

are web users really markovian ? user modeling on the web has rested on the fundamental assumption of markovian behavior -- a user 's next action depends only on her current state , and not the history leading up to the current state . this forms the underpinning of pagerank web ranking , as well as a number of techniques for targeting advertising to users . in this work we examine the validity of this assumption , using data from a number of web settings . our main result invokes statistical order estimation tests for markov chains to establish that web users are not , in fact , markovian . we study the extent to which the markovian assumption is invalid , and derive a number of avenues for further research .

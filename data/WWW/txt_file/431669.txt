characterization of a large web site population with implications for content delivery this paper presents a systematic study of the properties of a large number of web sites hosted by a major isp . to our knowledge , ours is the first comprehensive study of a large server farm that contains thousands of commercial web sites . we also perform a simulation analysis to estimate potential performance benefits of content delivery networks ( cdns ) for these web sites . we make several interesting observations about the current usage of web technologies and web site performance characteristics . first , compared with previous client workload studies , the web server farm workload contains a much higher degree of uncacheable responses and responses that require mandatory cache validations . a significant reason for this is that cookie use is prevalent among our population , especially among more popular sites . however , we found an indication of wide-spread indiscriminate usage of cookies , which unnecessarily impedes the use of many content delivery optimizations . we also found that most web sites do not utilize the cache-control features ofthe http 1.1 protocol , resulting in suboptimal performance . moreover , the implicit expiration time in client caches for responses is constrained by the maximum values allowed in the squid proxy . finally , our simulation results indicate that most web sites benefit from the use of a cdn . the amount of the benefit depends on site popularity , and , somewhat surprisingly , a cdn may increase the peak to average request ratio at the origin server because the cdn can decrease the average request rate more than the peak request rate .

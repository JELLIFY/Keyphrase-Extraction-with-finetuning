k-centralities : local approximations of global measures based on shortest paths a lot of centrality measures have been developed to analyze different aspects of importance . some of the most popular centrality measures ( e.g. betweenness centrality , closeness centrality ) are based on the calculation of shortest paths . this characteristic limits the applicability of these measures for larger networks . in this article we elaborate on the idea of bounded-distance shortest paths calculations . we claim criteria for k-centrality measures and we introduce one algorithm for calculating both betweenness and closeness based centralities . we also present normalizations for these measures . we show that k-centrality measures are good approximations for the corresponding centrality measures by achieving a tremendous gain of calculation time and also having linear calculation complexity o ( n ) for networks with constant average degree . this allows researchers to approximate centrality measures based on shortest paths for networks with millions of nodes or with high frequency in dynamically changing networks .

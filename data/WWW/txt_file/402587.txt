the yin\/yang web : xml syntax and rdf semantics xml is the w3c standard document format for writing and exchanging information on the web . rdf is the w3c standard model for describing the semantics and reasoning about information on the web . unfortunately , rdf and xml -- although very close to each other -- are based on two different paradigms . we argue that in order to lead the semantic web to its full potential , the syntax and the semantics of information needs to work together . to this end , we develop a model-theoretic semantics for the xml xquery 1.0 and xpath 2.0 data model , which provides a unified model for both xml and rdf . this unified model can serve as the basis for web applications that deal with both data and semantics . we illustrate the use of this model on a concrete information integration scenario . our approach enables each side of the fence to benefit from the other , notably , we show how the rdf world can take advantage of xml query languages , and how the xml world can take advantage of the reasoning capabilities available for rdf .

designing an architecture for delivering mobile information services to the rural developing world implementing successful rural computing applications requires addressing a number of significant challenges . recent advances in mobile phone computing capabilities make this device a likely candidate to address the client hardware constraints . long battery life , wireless connectivity , solid-state memory , low price and immediate utility all make it better suited to rural conditions than a pc . however , current mobile software platforms are not as appropriate . web-based mobile applications are hard to use , do not take advantage of the mobile phone 's media capabilities and require an online connection . custom mobile applications are difficult to develop and distribute . to address these limitations we present cam - a new framework for developing and deploying mobile computing applications in the rural developing world . cam applications are accessed by capturing barcodes using the mobile phone camera , or entering numeric strings with the keypad . supporting minimal navigation , direct linkage to paper practices and offline multi-media interaction , cam is uniquely adapted to rural device , user and infrastructure constraints . to illustrate the breadth of the framework , we list a number of cam-based applications that we have implemented or are planning . these include processing microfinance loans , facilitating rural supply chains , documenting grassroots innovation and accessing electronic medical histories .

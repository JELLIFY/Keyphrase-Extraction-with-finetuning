google news personalization : scalable online collaborative filtering several approaches to collaborative filtering have been studied but seldom have studies been reported for large ( several millionusers and items ) and dynamic ( the underlying item set is continually changing ) settings . in this paper we describe our approach to collaborative filtering for generating personalized recommendations for users of google news . we generate recommendations using three approaches : collaborative filtering using minhash clustering , probabilistic latent semantic indexing ( plsi ) , and covisitation counts . we combine recommendations from different algorithms using a linear model . our approach is content agnostic and consequently domain independent , making it easily adaptable for other applications and languages with minimal effort . this paper will describe our algorithms and system setup in detail , and report results of running the recommendations engine on google news .

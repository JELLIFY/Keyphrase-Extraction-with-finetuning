genealogical trees on the web : a search engine user perspective this paper presents an extensive study about the evolution of textual content on the web , which shows how some new pages are created from scratch while others are created using already existing content . we show that a significant fraction of the web is a byproduct of the latter case . we introduce the concept of web genealogical tree , in which every page in a web snapshot is classified into a component . we study in detail these components , characterizing the copies and identifying the relation between a source of content and a search engine , by comparing page relevance measures , documents returned by real queries performed in the past , and click-through data . we observe that sources of copies are more frequently returned by queries and more clicked than other documents .

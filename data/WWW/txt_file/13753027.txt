document hierarchies from text and links hierarchical taxonomies provide a multi-level view of large document collections , allowing users to rapidly drill down to fine-grained distinctions in topics of interest . we show that automatically induced taxonomies can be made more robust by combining text with relational links . the underlying mechanism is a bayesian generative model in which a latent hierarchical structure explains the observed data -- thus , finding hierarchical groups of documents with similar word distributions and dense network connections . as a nonparametric bayesian model , our approach does not require pre-specification of the branching factor at each non-terminal , but finds the appropriate level of detail directly from the data . unlike many prior latent space models of network structure , the complexity of our approach does not grow quadratically in the number of documents , enabling application to networks with more than ten thousand nodes . experimental results on hypertext and citation network corpora demonstrate the advantages of our hierarchical , multimodal approach .

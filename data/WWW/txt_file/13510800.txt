releasing search queries and clicks privately the question of how to publish an anonymized search log was brought to the forefront by a well-intentioned , but privacy-unaware aol search log release . since then a series of ad-hoc techniques have been proposed in the literature , though none are known to be provably private . in this paper , we take a major step towards a solution : we show how queries , clicks and their associated perturbed counts can be published in a manner that rigorously preserves privacy . our algorithm is decidedly simple to state , but non-trivial to analyze . on the opposite side of privacy is the question of whether the data we can safely publish is of any use . our findings offer a glimmer of hope : we demonstrate that a non-negligible fraction of queries and clicks can indeed be safely published via a collection of experiments on a real search log . in addition , we select an application , keyword generation , and show that the keyword suggestions generated from the perturbed data resemble those generated from the original data .

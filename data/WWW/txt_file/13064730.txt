choreography conformance via synchronizability choreography analysis has been a crucial problem in service oriented computing . interactions among services involve message exchanges across organizational boundaries in a distributed computing environment , and in order to build such systems in a reliable manner , it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing such interactions . choreography conformance involves verifying that a set of services behave according to a given choreography specification that characterizes their interactions . unfortunately this is an undecidable problem when services interact with asynchronous communication . in this paper we present techniques that identify if the interaction behavior for a set of services remain the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication . this is called the synchronizability problem and determining the synchronizability of a set of services has been an open problem for several years . we solve this problem in this paper . our results can be used to identify synchronizable services for which choreography conformance can be checked efficiently . our results on synchronizability are applicable to any software infrastructure that supports message-based interactions .

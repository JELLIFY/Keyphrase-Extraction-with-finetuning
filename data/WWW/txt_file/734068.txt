pagerank as a function of the damping factor pagerank is defined as the stationary state of a markov chain . the chain is obtained by perturbing the transition matrix induced by a web graph with a damping factor α that spreads uniformly part of the rank . the choice of α is eminently empirical , and in most cases the original suggestion α = 0.85 by brin and page is still used . recently , however , the behavior of pagerank with respect to changes in α was discovered to be useful in link-spam detection ( 21 ) . moreover , an analytical justification of the value chosen for α is still missing . in this paper , we give the first mathematical analysis of pagerank when α changes . in particular , we show that , contrarily to popular belief , for real-world graphs values of α close to 1 do not give a more meaningful ranking . then , we give closed-form formulae for pagerank derivatives of any order , and an extension of the power method that approximates them with convergence o ( tk αt ) for the k-th derivative . finally , we show a tight connection between iterated computation and analytical behavior by proving that the k-th iteration of the power method gives exactly the pagerank value obtained using a maclaurin polynomial of degree k. the latter result paves the way towards the application of analytical methods to the study of pagerank .

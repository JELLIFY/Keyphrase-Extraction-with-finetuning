query result clustering for object-level search query result clustering has recently attracted a lot of attention to provide users with a succinct overview of relevant results . however , little work has been done on organizing the query results for object-level search . object-level search result clustering is challenging because we need to support diverse similarity notions over object-specific features ( such as the price and weight of a product ) of heterogeneous domains . to address this challenge , we propose a hybrid subspace clustering algorithm called hydra . algorithm hydra captures the user perception of diverse similarity notions from millions of web pages and disambiguates different senses using feature-based subspace locality measures . our proposed solution , by combining wisdom of crowds and wisdom of data , achieves robustness and efficiency over existing approaches . we extensively evaluate our proposed framework and demonstrate how to enrich user experiences in object-level search using a real-world product search scenarios .

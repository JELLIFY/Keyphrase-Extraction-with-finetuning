sring : a structured non dht p2p overlay supporting string range queries this paper presents sring , a structured non dht p2p overlay that efficiently supports exact and range queries on multiple attribute values . in sring , all attribute values are interpreted as strings formed by a base alphabet and are published in the lexicographical order . two virtual rings are built : n-ring is built in a skip-list way for range partition and queries ; d-ring is built in a small-world way for the construction of n-ring . a leave-and-join based load balancing method is used to balance range overload in the network with heterogeneous nodes .

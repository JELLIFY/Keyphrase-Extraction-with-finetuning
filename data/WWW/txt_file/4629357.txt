model checking cobweb protocols for verification of html frames behavior html documents composed of frames can be difficult to write correctly . we demonstrate a technique that can be used by authors manually creating html documents ( or by document editors ) to verify that complex frame construction exhibits the intended behavior when browsed . the method is based on model checking ( an automated program verification technique ) , and on temporal logic specifications of expected frames behavior . we show how to model the html frames source as a cobweb protocol , related to the trellis model of hypermedia documents . we show how to convert the cobweb protocol to input for a model checker , and discuss several ways for authors to create the necessary behavior specifications . our solution allows web documents to be built containing a large number of frames and content pages interacting in complex ways . we expect such web structures to be more useful in `` literary '' hypermedia than for web `` sites '' used as interfaces to organizational information or databases .

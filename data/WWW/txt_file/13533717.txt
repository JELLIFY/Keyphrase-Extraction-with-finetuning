smart miner : a new framework for mining large scale web usage data in this paper , we propose a novel framework called smart-miner for web usage mining problem which uses link information for producing accurate user sessions and frequent navigation patterns . unlike the simple session concepts in the time and navigation based approaches , where sessions are sequences of web pages requested from the server or viewed in the browser , smart miner sessions are set of paths traversed in the web graph that corresponds to users ' navigations among web pages . we have modeled session construction as a new graph problem and utilized a new algorithm , smart-sra , to solve this problem efficiently . for the pattern discovery phase , we have developed an efficient version of the apriori-all technique which uses the structure of web graph to increase the performance . from the experiments that we have performed on both real and simulated data , we have observed that smart-miner produces at least 30 % more accurate web usage patterns than other approaches including previous session construction methods . we have also studied the effect of having the referrer information in the web server logs to show that different versions of smart-sra produce similar results . our another contribution is that we have implemented distributed version of the smart miner framework by employing map\/reduce paradigm . we conclude that we can efficiently process terabytes of web server logs belonging to multiple web sites by our scalable framework .

test case prioritization for regression testing of service-oriented business applications regression testing assures the quality of modified service-oriented business applications against unintended changes . however , a typical regression test suite is large in size . earlier execution of those test cases that may detect failures is attractive . many existing prioritization techniques order test cases according to their respective coverage of program statements in a previous version of the application . on the other hand , industrial service-oriented business applications are typically written in orchestration languages such as ws-bpel and integrated with workflow steps and web services via xpath and wsdl . faults in these artifacts may cause the application to extract wrong data from messages , leading to failures in service compositions . surprisingly , current regression testing research hardly considers these artifacts . we propose a multilevel coverage model to capture the business process , xpath , and wsdl from the perspective of regression testing . we develop a family of test case prioritization techniques atop the model . empirical results show that our techniques can achieve significantly higher rates of fault detection than existing techniques .

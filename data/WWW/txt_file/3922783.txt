information retrieval in p2p networks using genetic algorithm hybrid peer-to-peer ( p2p ) networks based on the direct connection model have two shortcomings which are high bandwidth consumption and poor semi-parallel search . however , they can further be improved by the query propagation model . in this paper , we propose a novel query routing strategy called garoute based on the query propagation model . by giving the current p2p network topology and relevance level of each peer , garoute returns a list of query routing paths that cover as many relevant peers as possible . we model this as the longest path problem in a directed graph which is np-complete and we obtain high quality ( 0.95 in 100 peers ) approximate solutions in polynomial time by using genetic algorithm ( ga ) . we describe the problem modeling and proposed ga for finding long paths . finally , we summarize the experimental results which measure the scalability and quality of different searching algorithms . according to these results , garoute works well in some large scaled p2p networks .

very sparse random projections there has been considerable interest in random projections , an approximate algorithm for estimating distances between pairs of points in a high-dimensional vector space . let a in rn x d be our n points in d dimensions . the method multiplies a by a random matrix r in rd x k , reducing the d dimensions down to just k for speeding up the computation . r typically consists of entries of standard normal n ( 0,1 ) . it is well known that random projections preserve pairwise distances ( in the expectation ) . achlioptas proposed sparse random projections by replacing the n ( 0,1 ) entries in r with entries in -1,0,1 with probabilities 1\/6 , 2\/3 , 1\/6 , achieving a threefold speedup in processing time . we recommend using r of entries in -1,0,1 with probabilities 1\/2 √ d , 1-1 √ d , 1\/2 √ d for achieving a significant √ d-fold speedup , with little loss in accuracy .

background knowledge for ontology construction in this paper we describe a solution for incorporating background knowledge into the ontogen system for semi-automatic ontology construction . this makes it easier for different users to construct different and more personalized ontologies for the same domain . to achieve this we introduce a word weighting schema to be used in the document representation . the weighting schema is learned based on the background knowledge provided by user . it is than used by ontogen 's machine learning and text mining algorithms .

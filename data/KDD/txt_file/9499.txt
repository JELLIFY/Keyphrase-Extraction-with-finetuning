a generalized maximum entropy approach to bregman co-clustering and matrix approximation co-clustering is a powerful data mining technique with varied applications such as text clustering , microarray analysis and recommender systems . recently , an information-theoretic co-clustering approach applicable to empirical joint probability distributions was proposed . in many situations , co-clustering of more general matrices is desired . in this paper , we present a substantially generalized co-clustering framework wherein any bregman divergence can be used in the objective function , and various conditional expectation based constraints can be considered based on the statistics that need to be preserved . analysis of the co-clustering problem leads to the minimum bregman information principle , which generalizes the maximum entropy principle , and yields an elegant meta algorithm that is guaranteed to achieve local optimality . our methodology yields new algorithms and also encompasses several previously known clustering and co-clustering algorithms based on alternate minimization .

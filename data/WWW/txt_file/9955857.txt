web-scale classification with naive bayes traditional naive bayes classifier performs miserably on web-scale taxonomies . in this paper , we investigate the reasons behind such bad performance . we discover that the low performance are not completely caused by the intrinsic limitations of naive bayes , but mainly comes from two largely ignored problems : contradiction pair problem and discriminative evidence cancelation problem . we propose modifications that can alleviate the two problems while preserving the advantages of naive bayes . the experimental results show our modified naive bayes can significantly improve the performance on real web-scale taxonomies .

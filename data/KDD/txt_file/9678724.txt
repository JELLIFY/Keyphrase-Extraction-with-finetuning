cut-and-stitch : efficient parallel learning of linear dynamical systems on smps multi-core processors with ever increasing number of cores per chip are becoming prevalent in modern parallel computing . our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up data mining algorithms . specifically , we present a parallel algorithm for approximate learning of linear dynamical systems ( lds ) , also known as kalman filters ( kf ) . ldss are widely used in time series analysis such as motion capture modeling , visual tracking etc. . we propose cut-and-stitch ( cas ) , a novel method to handle the data dependencies from the chain structure of hidden variables in lds , so as to parallelize the em-based parameter learning algorithm . we implement the algorithm using openmp on both a supercomputer and a quad-core commercial desktop . the experimental results show that parallel algorithms using cut-and-stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the serial version . in addition , cut-and-stitch can be generalized to other models with similar linear structures such as hidden markov models ( hmm ) and switching kalman filters ( skf ) .

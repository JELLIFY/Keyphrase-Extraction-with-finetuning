using the wisdom of the crowds for keyword generation in the sponsored search model , search engines are paid by businesses that are interested in displaying ads for their site alongside the search results . businesses bid for keywords , and their ad is displayed when the keyword is queried to the search engine . an important problem in this process is ` keyword generation ' : given a business that is interested in launching a campaign , suggest keywords that are related to that campaign . we address this problem by making use of the query logs of the search engine . we identify queries related to a campaign by exploiting the associations between queries and urls as they are captured by the user 's clicks . these queries form good keyword suggestions since they capture the `` wisdom of the crowd '' as to what is related to a site . we formulate the problem as a semi-supervised learning problem , and propose algorithms within the markov random field model . we perform experiments with real query logs , and we demonstrate that our algorithms scale to large query logs and produce meaningful results .

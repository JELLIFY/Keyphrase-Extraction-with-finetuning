compiling xslt 2.0 into xquery 1.0 as xquery is gathering momentum as the standard query language for xml , there is a growing interest in using it as an integral part of the xml application development infrastructure . in that context , one question which is often raised is how well xquery interoperates with other xml languages , and notably with xslt . xquery 1.0 ( 16 ) and xslt 2.0 ( 7 ) share a lot in common : they share xpath 2.0 as a common sub-language and have the same expressiveness . however , they are based on fairly different programming paradigms . while xslt has adopted a highly declarative template based approach , xquery relies on a simpler , and more operational , functional approach . in this paper , we present an approach to compile xslt 2.0 into xquery 1.0 , and a working implementation of that approach . the compilation rules explain how xslt 's template-based approach can be implemented using the functional approach of xquery and underpins the tight connection between the two languages . the resulting compiler can be used to migrate a xslt code base to xquery , or to enable the use of xquery runtimes ( e.g. , as will soon be provided by most relational database management systems ) for xslt users . we also identify a number of areas where compatibility between the two languages could be improved . finally , we show experiments on actual xslt stylesheets , demonstrating the applicability of the approach in practice .

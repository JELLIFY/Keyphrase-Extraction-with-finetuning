detecting image spam using local invariant features and pyramid match kernel image spam is a new obfuscating method which spammers invented to more effectively bypass conventional text based spam filters . in this paper , we extract local invariant features of images and run a one-class svm classifier which uses the pyramid match kernel as the kernel function to detect image spam . experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is effective for fighting image spam .

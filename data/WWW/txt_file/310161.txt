a service creation environment based on end to end composition of web services the demand for quickly delivering new applications is increasingly becoming a business imperative today . application development is often done in an ad hoc manner , without standard frameworks or libraries , thus resulting in poor reuse of software assets . web services have received much interest in industry due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration . a web services composition tool can help automate the process , from creating business process functionality , to developing executable workflows , to deploying them on an execution environment . however , we find that the main approaches taken thus far to standardize and compose web services are piecemeal and insufficient . the business world has adopted a ( distributed ) programming approach in which web service instances are described using wsdl , composed into flows with a language like bpel and invoked with the soap protocol . academia has propounded the ai approach of formally representing web service capabilities in ontologies , and reasoning about their composition using goal-oriented inferencing techniques from planning . we present the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the above approaches . we describe a prototype service creation environment along with a use-case scenario , and demonstrate how it can significantly speed up the time-to-market for new services .

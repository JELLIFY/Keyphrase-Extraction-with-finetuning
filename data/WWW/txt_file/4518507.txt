querying and maintaining a compact xml storage as xml database sizes grow , the amount of space used for storing the data and auxiliary data structures becomes a major factor in query and update performance . this paper presents a new storage scheme for xml data that supports all navigational operations in near constant time . in addition to supporting efficient queries , the space requirement of the proposed scheme is within a constant factor of the information theoretic minimum , while insertions and deletions can be performed in near constant time as well . as a result , the proposed structure features a small memory footprint that increases cache locality , whilst still supporting standard apis , such as dom , and necessary database operations , such as queries and updates , efficiently . analysis and experiments show that the proposed structure is space and time efficient .

detecting web page structure for adaptive viewing on small form factor devices mobile devices have already been widely used to access the web . however , because most available web pages are designed for desktop pc in mind , it is inconvenient to browse these large web pages on a mobile device with a small screen . in this paper , we propose a new browsing convention to facilitate navigation and reading on a small-form-factor device . a web page is organized into a two level hierarchy with a thumbnail representation at the top level for providing a global view and index to a set of sub-pages at the bottom level for detail information . a page adaptation technique is also developed to analyze the structure of an existing web page and split it into small and logically related units that fit into the screen of a mobile device . for a web page not suitable for splitting , auto-positioning or scrolling-by-block is used to assist the browsing as an alterative . our experimental results show that our proposed browsing convention and developed page adaptation scheme greatly improve the user 's browsing experiences on a device with a small display .

image annotation using search and mining technologies in this paper , we present a novel solution to the image annotation problem which annotates images using search and data mining technologies . an accurate keyword is required to initialize this process , and then leveraging a large-scale image database , it 1 ) searches for semantically and visually similar images , 2 ) and mines annotations from them . a notable advantage of this approach is that it enables unlimited vocabulary , while it is not possible for all existing approaches . experimental results on real web images show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm .

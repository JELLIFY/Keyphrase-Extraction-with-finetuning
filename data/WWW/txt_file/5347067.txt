from user-centric web traffic data to usage data in this paper , we describe a user-centric internet usage data processing platform . raw usage data is collected using a software probe installed on a panel of internet users ' workstations . it is then processed by our platform . the transformation of raw usage data into qualified and usable information by internet usage sociology researchers means setting up a series of relatively complex processes using quite a wide variety of resources . we use a combination of ad hoc rule-based systems and external resources to qualify the visited web pages . we also implemented topological and temporal indicators in order to describe the dynamics of web sessions .

collective annotation of wikipedia entities in web text to take the first step beyond keyword-based search toward entity-based search , suitable token spans ( `` spots '' ) on documents must be identified as references to real-world entities from an entity catalog . several systems have been proposed to link spots on web pages to entities in wikipedia . they are largely based on local compatibility between the text around the spot and textual metadata associated with the entity . two recent systems exploit inter-label dependencies , but in limited ways . we propose a general collective disambiguation approach . our premise is that coherent documents refer to entities from one or a few related topics or domains . we give formulations for the trade-off between local spot-to-entity compatibility and measures of global coherence between entities . optimizing the overall entity assignment is np-hard . we investigate practical solutions based on local hill-climbing , rounding integer linear programs , and pre-clustering entities followed by local optimization within clusters . in experiments involving over a hundred manually-annotated web pages and tens of thousands of spots , our approaches significantly outperform recently-proposed algorithms .

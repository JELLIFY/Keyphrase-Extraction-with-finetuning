the two cultures : mashing up web 2.0 and the semantic web a common perception is that there are two competing visions for the future evolution of the web : the semantic web and web 2.0 . a closer look , though , reveals that the core technologies and concerns of these two approaches are complementary and that each field can and must draw from the other 's strengths . we believe that future web applications will retain the web 2.0 focus on community and usability , while drawing on semantic web infrastructure to facilitate mashup-like information sharing . however , there are several open issues that must be addressed before such applications can become commonplace . in this paper , we outline a semantic weblogs scenario that illustrates the potential for combining web 2.0 and semantic web technologies , while highlighting the unresolved issues that impede its realization . nevertheless , we believe that the scenario can be realized in the short-term . we point to recent progress made in resolving each of the issues as well as future research directions for each of the communities .

merkle tree authentication of http responses we propose extensions to existing web protocols that allow proofs of authenticity of http server responses , whether or not the http server is under the control of the publisher . these extensions protect users from content that may be substituted by malicious servers , and therefore have immediate applications in improving the security of web caching , mirroring , and relaying systems that rely on untrusted machines ( 2,4 ) . our proposal relies on merkle trees to support 200 and 404 response authentication while requiring only a single cryptographic hash of trusted data per repository . while existing web protocols such as https can provide authenticity guarantees ( in addition to confidentiality ) , https consumes significantly more computational resources , and requires that the hosting server act without malice in generating responses and in protecting the publisher 's private key .

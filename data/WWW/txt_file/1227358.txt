fluid annotations through open hypermedia : using and extending emerging web standards the fluid documents project has developed various research prototypes that show that powerful annotation techniques based on animated typographical changes can help readers utilize annotations more effectively . our recently-developed fluid open hypermedia prototype supports the authoring and browsing of fluid annotations on third-party web pages . this prototype is an extension of the arakne environment , an open hypermedia application that can augment web pages with externally stored hypermedia structures . this paper describes how various web standards , including dom , css , xlink , xpointer , and rdf , can be used and extended to support fluid annotations .

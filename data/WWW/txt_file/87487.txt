xl : an xml programming language for web service specification and composition we present an xml programming language specially designed for the implementation of web services . xl is portable and fully compliant with w3c standards such as xquery , xml protocol , and xml schema . one of the key features of xl is that it allows programmers to concentrate on the logic of their application . xl provides high-level and declarative constructs for actions which are typically carried out in the implementation of a web service ; e.g. , logging , error handling , retry of actions , workload management , events , etc. . issues such as performance tuning ( e.g. , caching , horizontal partitioning , etc. ) should be carried out automatically by an implementation of the language . this way , the productivity of the programmers , the ability of evolution of the programs , and the chances to achieve good performance are substantially enhanced .

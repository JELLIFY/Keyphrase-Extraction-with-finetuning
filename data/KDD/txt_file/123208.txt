algorithms for estimating relative importance in networks large and complex graphs representing relationships among sets of entities are an increasingly common focus of interest in data analysis -- examples include social networks , web graphs , telecommunication networks , and biological networks . in interactive analysis of such data a natural query is `` which entities are most important in the network relative to a particular individual or set of individuals ? '' we investigate the problem of answering such queries in this paper , focusing in particular on defining and computing the importance of nodes in a graph relative to one or more root nodes . we define a general framework and a number of different algorithms , building on ideas from social networks , graph theory , markov models , and web graph analysis . we experimentally evaluate the different properties of these algorithms on toy graphs and demonstrate how our approach can be used to study relative importance in real-world networks including a network of interactions among september 11th terrorists , a network of collaborative research in biotechnology among companies and universities , and a network of co-authorship relationships among computer science researchers .

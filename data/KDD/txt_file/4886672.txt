mining for misconfigured machines in grid systems grid systems are proving increasingly useful for managing the batch computing jobs of organizations . one well-known example is intel , whose internally developed netbatch system manages tens of thousands of machines . the size , heterogeneity , and complexity of grid systems make them very difficult , however , to configure . this often results in misconfigured machines , which may adversely affect the entire system . we investigate a distributed data mining approach for detection of misconfigured machines . our grid monitoring system ( gms ) non-intrusively collects data from all sources ( log files , system services , etc. ) available throughout the grid system . it converts raw data to semantically meaningful data and stores this data on the machine it was obtained from , limiting incurred overhead and allowing scalability . afterwards , when analysis is requested , a distributed outliers detection algorithm is employed to identify misconfigured machines . the algorithm itself is implemented as a recursive workflow of grid jobs . it is especially suited to grid systems , in which the machines might be unavailable most of the time and often fail altogether .

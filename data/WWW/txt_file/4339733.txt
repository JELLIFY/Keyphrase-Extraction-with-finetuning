a new suffix tree similarity measure for document clustering in this paper , we propose a new similarity measure to compute the pairwise similarity of text-based documents based on suffix tree document model . by applying the new suffix tree similarity measure in group-average agglomerative hierarchical clustering ( gahc ) algorithm , we developed a new suffix tree document clustering algorithm ( nstc ) . experimental results on two standard document clustering benchmark corpus ohsumed and rcv1 indicate that the new clustering algorithm is a very effective document clustering algorithm . comparing with the results of traditional word term weight tf-idf similarity measure in the same gahc algorithm , nstc achieved an improvement of 51 % on the average of f-measure score . furthermore , we apply the new clustering algorithm in analyzing the web documents in online forum communities . a topic oriented clustering algorithm is developed to help people in assessing , classifying and searching the the web documents in a large forum community .

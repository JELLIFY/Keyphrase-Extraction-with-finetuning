sequential cost-sensitive decision making with reinforcement learning recently , there has been increasing interest in the issues of cost-sensitive learning and decision making in a variety of applications of data mining . a number of approaches have been developed that are effective at optimizing cost-sensitive decisions when each decision is considered in isolation . however , the issue of sequential decision making , with the goal of maximizing total benefits accrued over a period of time instead of immediate benefits , has rarely been addressed . in the present paper , we propose a novel approach to sequential decision making based on the reinforcement learning framework . our approach attempts to learn decision rules that optimize a sequence of cost-sensitive decisions so as to maximize the total benefits accrued over time . we use the domain of targeted ' marketing as a testbed for empirical evaluation of the proposed method . we conducted experiments using approximately two years of monthly promotion data derived from the well-known kdd cup 1998 donation data set . the experimental results show that the proposed method for optimizing total accrued benefits out performs the usual targeted-marketing methodology of optimizing each promotion in isolation . we also analyze the behavior of the targeting rules that were obtained and discuss their appropriateness to the application domain .

mapping xml instances for xml-based applications in general and b2b applications in particular , mapping between differently structured xml documents , to enable exchange of data , is a basic problem . a generic solution to the problem is of interest and desirable both in an academic and practical sense . we present a case study of the problem that arises in an xml based project , which involves mapping of different xml schemas to each other . we describe our approach to solving the problem , its advantages and limitations . we also compare and contrast our approach with previously known approaches and commercially available software solutions .

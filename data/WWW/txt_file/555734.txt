debugging owl ontologies as an increasingly large number of owl ontologies become available on the semantic web and the descriptions in the ontologies become more complicated , finding the cause of errors becomes an extremely hard task even for experts . existing ontology development environments provide some limited support , in conjunction with a reasoner , for detecting and diagnosing errors in owl ontologies . typically these are restricted to the mere detection of , for example , unsatisfiable concepts . we have integrated a number of simple debugging cues generated from our description logic reasoner , pellet , in our hypertextual ontology development environment , swoop . these cues , in conjunction with extensive undo\/redo and annotea based collaboration support in swoop , significantly improve the owl debugging experience , and point the way to more general improvements in the presentation of an ontology to new users .

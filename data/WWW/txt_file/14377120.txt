echoes of power : language effects and power differences in social interaction understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities . most current work focuses on structural properties : who talks to whom , and how such interactions form larger network structures . the interactions themselves , however , generally take place in the form of natural language -- either spoken or written -- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles , status , and other aspects of the group 's dynamics . to date , however , finding domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge . here , we show that in group discussions , power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to . starting from this observation , we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power -- including a more `` static '' form of power based on status differences , and a more `` situational '' form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another . using this framework , we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings : discussions among wikipedians and arguments before the u. s. supreme court .

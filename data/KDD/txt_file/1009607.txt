rotation invariant distance measures for trajectories for the discovery of similar patterns in 1d time-series , it is very typical to perform a normalization of the data ( for example a transformation so that the data follow a zero mean and unit standard deviation ) . such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are very commonly used in datamining applications . however , when dealing with multidimensional time-series , which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking , motion-capture etc , similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations . it is therefore imperative to provide support for additional transformations , such as rotation . in this work , we transform the positional information of moving data , into a space that is translation , scale and rotation invariant . our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matches and can be efficiently lower bounded , thus being computationally tractable . the proposed methods are easy to implement , fast to compute and can have many applications for real world problems , in areas such as handwriting recognition and posture estimation in motion-capture data . finally , we empirically demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the technique , using real and synthetic handwriting data .

robust information-theoretic clustering how do we find a natural clustering of a real world point set , which contains an unknown number of clusters with different shapes , and which may be contaminated by noise ? most clustering algorithms were designed with certain assumptions ( gaussianity ) , they often require the user to give input parameters , and they are sensitive to noise . in this paper , we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given data set , based on the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle . the proposed framework , robust information-theoretic clustering ( ric ) , is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm : given a preliminary clustering , ric purifies these clusters from noise , and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape ( subspace ) of the clusters . our ric method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from k-means and k-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering . in fact , ric is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering , even if we start with very simple methods such as grid-based space partitioning . moreover , ric scales well with the data set size . extensive experiments on synthetic and real world data sets validate the proposed ric framework .

boosting with structure information in the functional space : an application to graph classification boosting is a very successful classification algorithm that produces a linear combination of `` weak '' classifiers ( a.k.a. base learners ) to obtain high quality classification models . in this paper we propose a new boosting algorithm where base learners have structure relationships in the functional space . though such relationships are generic , our work is particularly motivated by the emerging topic of pattern based classification for semi-structured data including graphs . towards an efficient incorporation of the structure information , we have designed a general model where we use an undirected graph to capture the relationship of subgraph-based base learners . in our method , we combine both l1 norm and laplacian based l2 norm penalty with logit loss function of logit boost . in this approach , we enforce model sparsity and smoothness in the functional space spanned by the basis functions . we have derived efficient optimization algorithms based on coordinate decent for the new boosting formulation and theoretically prove that it exhibits a natural grouping effect for nearby spatial or overlapping features . using comprehensive experimental study , we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed learning methods .

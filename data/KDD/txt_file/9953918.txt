large-scale behavioral targeting behavioral targeting ( bt ) leverages historical user behavior to select the ads most relevant to users to display . the state-of-the-art of bt derives a linear poisson regression model from fine-grained user behavioral data and predicts click-through rate ( ctr ) from user history . we designed and implemented a highly scalable and efficient solution to bt using hadoop mapreduce framework . with our parallel algorithm and the resulting system , we can build above 450 bt-category models from the entire yahoo 's user base within one day , the scale that one can not even imagine with prior systems . moreover , our approach has yielded 20 % ctr lift over the existing production system by leveraging the well-grounded probabilistic model fitted from a much larger training dataset . specifically , our major contributions include : ( 1 ) a mapreduce statistical learning algorithm and implementation that achieve optimal data parallelism , task parallelism , and load balance in spite of the typically skewed distribution of domain data . ( 2 ) an in-place feature vector generation algorithm with linear time complexity o ( n ) regardless of the granularity of sliding target window . ( 3 ) an in-memory caching scheme that significantly reduces the number of disk ios to make large-scale learning practical . ( 4 ) highly efficient data structures and sparse representations of models and data to enable fast model updates . we believe that our work makes significant contributions to solving large-scale machine learning problems of industrial relevance in general . finally , we report comprehensive experimental results , using industrial proprietary codebase and datasets .

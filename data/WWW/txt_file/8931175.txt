efficient pagerank approximation via graph aggregation we present a framework for approximating random-walk based probability distributions over web pages using graph aggregation . we ( 1 ) partition the web 's graph into classes of quasi-equivalent vertices , ( 2 ) project the page-based random walk to be approximated onto those classes , and ( 3 ) compute the stationary probability distribution of the resulting class-based random walk . from this distribution we can quickly reconstruct a distribution on pages . inparticular , our framework can approximate the well-known pagerank distribution by setting the classes according to the set of pages on each web host . we experimented on a web-graph containing over 1.4 billion pages , and were able to produce a ranking that has spearman rank-order correlation of 0.95 with respect to pagerank . a simplistic implementation of our method required less than half the running time of a highly optimized implementation of pagerank , implying that larger speedup factors are probably possible .

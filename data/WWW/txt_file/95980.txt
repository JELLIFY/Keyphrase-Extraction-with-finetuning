an event-condition-action language for xml xml repositories are now a widespread means for storing and exchanging information on the web . as these repositories become increasingly used in dynamic applications such as e-commerce , there is a rapidly growing need for a mechanism to incorporate reactive functionality in an xml setting . event-condition-action ( eca ) rules are a technology from active databases and are a natural method for supporting suchfunctionality . eca rules can be used for activities such as automatically enforcing document constraints , maintaining repository statistics , and facilitating publish\/subscribe applications . an important question associated with the use of a eca rules is how to statically predict their run-time behavior . in this paper , we define a language for eca rules on xml repositories . we then investigate methods for analyzing the behavior of a set of eca rules , a task which has added complexity in this xml setting compared with conventional active databases .

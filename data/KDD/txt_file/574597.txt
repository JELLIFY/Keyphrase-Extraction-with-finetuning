immc : incremental maximum margin criterion subspace learning approaches have attracted much attention in academia recently . however , the classical batch algorithms no longer satisfy the applications on streaming data or large-scale data . to meet this desirability , incremental principal component analysis ( ipca ) algorithm has been well established , but it is an unsupervised subspace learning approach and is not optimal for general classification tasks , such as face recognition and web document categorization . in this paper , we propose an incremental supervised subspace learning algorithm , called incremental maximum margin criterion ( immc ) , to infer an adaptive subspace by optimizing the maximum margin criterion . we also present the proof for convergence of the proposed algorithm . experimental results on both synthetic dataset and real world datasets show that immc converges to the similar subspace as that of batch approach .

unsupervised learning of soft patterns for generating definitions from online news breaking news often contains timely definitions and descriptions of current terms , organizations and personalities . we utilize such web sources to construct definitions for such terms . previous work has identified definitions using hand-crafted rules or supervised learning that constructs rigid , hard text patterns . in contrast , we demonstrate a new approach that uses flexible , soft matching patterns to characterize definition sentences . our soft patterns are able to effectively accommodate the diversity of definition sentence structure exhibited in news . we use pseudo-relevance feedback to automatically label sentences for use in soft pattern generation . the application of our unsupervised method significantly improves baseline systems on both the standardized trec corpus as well as crawled online news articles by 27 % and 30 % , respectively , in terms of f measure . when applied to a state-of-art definition generation system recently fielded in the trec 2003 definitional question answering task , it improves the performance by 14 % .

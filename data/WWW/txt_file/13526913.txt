co-browsing dynamic web pages collaborative browsing , or co-browsing , is the co-navigation of the web with other people at-a-distance , supported by software that takes care of synchronizing the browsers . current state-of-the-art solutions are able to do co-browsing of `` static web pages '' , and do not support the synchronization of javascript interactions . however , currently many web pages use javascript and ajax techniques to create highly dynamic and interactive web applications . in this paper , we describe two approaches for co-browsing that both support the synchronization of the javascript and ajax interactions of dynamic web pages . one approach is based on synchronizing the output of the javascript engine by sending over the changes made on the dom tree . the other approach is based on synchronizing the input of the javascript engine by synchronizing ui events and incoming data . since the latter solution offers a better user experience and is more scalable , it is elaborated in more detail . an important aspect of both approaches is that they operate at the dom level . therefore , the client-side can be implemented in javascript and no browser extensions are required . to the best of the authors ' knowledge this is the first dom-level co-browsing solution that also enables co-browsing of the dynamic interaction parts of web pages . the presented co-browsing solution has been implemented in a research demonstrator which allows users to do co-browsing of web-applications on browser-based networked televisions .

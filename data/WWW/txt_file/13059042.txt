ranking related entities for web search queries entity ranking is a recent paradigm that refers to retrieving and ranking related objects and entities from different structured sources in various scenarios . entities typically have associated categories and relationships with other entities . in this work , we present an extensive analysis of web-scale entity ranking , based on machine learned ranking models using an ensemble of pairwise preference models . our proposed system for entity ranking uses structured knowledge bases , entity relationship graphs and user data to derive useful features to facilitate semantic search with entities directly within the learning to rank framework . the experimental results are validated on a large-scale graph containing millions of entities and hundreds of millions of entity relationships . we show that our proposed ranking solution clearly improves a simple user behavior based ranking model .

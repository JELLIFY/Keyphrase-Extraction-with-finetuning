privacy-preserving bayesian network structure computation on distributed heterogeneous data as more and more activities are carried out using computers and computer networks , the amount of potentially sensitive data stored by business , governments , and other parties increases . different parties may wish to benefit from cooperative use of their data , but privacy regulations and other privacy concerns may prevent the parties from sharing their data . privacy-preserving data mining provides a solution by creating distributed data mining algorithms in which the underlying data is not revealed . in this paper , we present a privacy-preserving protocol for a particular data mining task : learning the bayesian network structure for distributed heterogeneous data . in this setting , two parties owning confidential databases wish to learn the structure of bayesian network on the combination of their databases without revealing anything about their data to each other . we give an efficient and privacy-preserving version of the k2 algorithm to construct the structure of a bayesian network for the parties ' joint data .

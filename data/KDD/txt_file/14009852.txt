prominent streak discovery in sequence data this paper studies the problem of prominent streak discovery in sequence data . given a sequence of values , a prominent streak is a long consecutive subsequence consisting of only large ( small ) values . for finding prominent streaks , we make the observation that prominent streaks are skyline points in two dimensions - streak interval length and minimum value in the interval . our solution thus hinges upon the idea to separate the two steps in prominent streak discovery ' candidate streak generation and skyline operation over candidate streaks . for candidate generation , we propose the concept of local prominent streak ( lps ) . we prove that prominent streaks are a subset of lpss and the number of lpss is less than the length of a data sequence , in comparison with the quadratic number of candidates produced by a brute-force baseline method . we develop efficient algorithms based on the concept of lps . the non-linear lps-based method ( nlps ) considers a superset of lpss as candidates , and the linear lps-based method ( llps ) further guarantees to consider only lpss . the results of experiments using multiple real datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods and showed orders of magnitude performance improvement against the baseline method .

cost-effective outbreak detection in networks given a water distribution network , where should we place sensors toquickly detect contaminants ? or , which blogs should we read to avoid missing important stories ? . these seemingly different problems share common structure : outbreak detection can be modeled as selecting nodes ( sensor locations , blogs ) in a network , in order to detect the spreading of a virus or information asquickly as possible . we present a general methodology for near optimal sensor placement in these and related problems . we demonstrate that many realistic outbreak detection objectives ( e.g. , detection likelihood , population affected ) exhibit the property of `` submodularity '' . we exploit submodularity to develop an efficient algorithm that scales to large problems , achieving near optimal placements , while being 700 times faster than a simple greedy algorithm . we also derive online bounds on the quality of the placements obtained by any algorithm . our algorithms and bounds also handle cases where nodes ( sensor locations , blogs ) have different costs . we evaluate our approach on several large real-world problems , including a model of a water distribution network from the epa , andreal blog data . the obtained sensor placements are provably near optimal , providing a constant fraction of the optimal solution . we show that the approach scales , achieving speedups and savings in storage of several orders of magnitude . we also show how the approach leads to deeper insights in both applications , answering multicriteria trade-off , cost-sensitivity and generalization questions .

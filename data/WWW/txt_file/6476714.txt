multimedia meets computer graphics in smil2 .0 : a time model for the web multimedia scheduling models provide a rich variety of tools for managing the synchronization of media like video and audio , but generally have an inflexible model for time itself . in contrast , modern animation models in the computer graphics community generally lack tools for synchronization and structural time , but allow for a flexible concept of time , including variable pacing , acceleration and deceleration and other tools useful for controlling and adapting animation behaviors . multimedia authors have been forced to choose one set of features over the others , limiting the range of presentations they can create . some programming models addressed some of these problems , but provided no declarative means for authors and authoring tools to leverage the functionality . this paper describes a new model incorporated into smil 2.0 that combines the strengths of scheduling models with the flexible time manipulations of animation models . the implications of this integration are discussed with respect to scheduling and structured time , drawing upon experience with smil 2.0 timing and synchronization , and the integration with xhtml .

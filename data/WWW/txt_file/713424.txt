mining rdf metadata for generalized association rules : knowledge discovery in the semantic web era in this paper , we present a novel frequent generalized pattern mining algorithm , called gp-close , for mining generalized associations from rdf metadata . to solve the over-generalization problem encountered by existing methods , gp-close employs the notion of emphgeneralization closure for systematic over-generalization reduction .

debugging standard document formats we present a tool for helping xml schema designers to obtain a high quality level for their specifications . the tool allows one to analyze relations between classes of xml documents and formally prove them . for instance , the tool can be used to check forward and backward compatibilities of recommendations . when such a relation does not hold , the tool allows one to identify the reasons and reports detailed counter-examples that exemplify the problem . for this purpose , the tool relies on recent advances in logic-based automated theorem proving techniques that allow for efficient reasoning on very large sets of xml documents . we believe this tool can be of great value for standardization bodies that define specifications using various xml type definition languages ( such as w3c specifications ) , and are concerned with quality assurance for their normative recommendations .

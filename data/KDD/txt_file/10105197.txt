co-evolution of social and affiliation networks in our work , we address the problem of modeling social network generation which explains both link and group formation . recent studies on social network evolution propose generative models which capture the statistical properties of real-world networks related only to node-to-node link formation . we propose a novel model which captures the co-evolution of social and affiliation networks . we provide surprising insights into group formation based on observations in several real-world networks , showing that users often join groups for reasons other than their friends . our experiments show that the model is able to capture both the newly observed and previously studied network properties . this work is the first to propose a generative model which captures the statistical properties of these complex networks . the proposed model facilitates controlled experiments which study the effect of actors ' behavior on the evolution of affiliation networks , and it allows the generation of realistic synthetic datasets .

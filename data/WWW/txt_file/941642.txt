catts : calendar types and constraints for web applications data referring to cultural calendars such as the widespread gregorian dates but also dates after the chinese , hebrew , or islamic calendars as well as data referring to professional calendars like fiscal years or teaching terms are omnipresent on the web . formalisms such as xml schema have acknowledged this by offering a rather extensive set of gregorian dates and times as basic data types . this article introduces into catts , the ( u ) c ( \/ u ) alendar ( u ) a ( \/ u ) nd ( u ) t ( \/ u ) ime ( u ) t ( \/ u ) ype ( u ) s ( \/ u ) ystem . catts goes far beyond predefined date and time types after the gregorian calendar as supported by xml schema . catts first gives rise to declaratively specify more or less complex cultural or professional calendars including specificities such as leap seconds , leap years , and time zones . catts further offers a tool for the static type checking ( of data typed after calendar ( s ) defined in catts ) . catts finally offers a language for declaratively expressing and a solver for efficiently solving temporal constraints ( referring to calendar ( s ) expressed in catts ) . catts complements data modeling and reasoning methods designed for generic semantic web applications such as rdf or owl with methods specific to the particular application domain of calendars and time .

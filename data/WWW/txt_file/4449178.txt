utility analysis for topically biased pagerank pagerank is known to be an efficient metric for computing general document importance in the web . while commonly used as a one-size-fits-all measure , the ability to produce topically biased ranks has not yet been fully explored in detail . in particular , it was still unclear to what granularity of `` topic '' the computation of biased page ranks makes sense . in this paper we present the results of a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of biasing pagerank on open directory categories . we show that the map quality of biased pagerank generally increases with the odp level up to a certain point , thus sustaining the usage of more specialized categories to bias pagerank on , in order to improve topic specific search .

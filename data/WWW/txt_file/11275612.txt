entity relation discovery from web tables and links the world-wide web consists not only of a huge number of unstructured texts , but also a vast amount of valuable structured data . web tables ( 2 ) are a typical type of structured information that are pervasive on the web , and web-scale methods that automatically extract web tables have been studied extensively ( 1 ) . many powerful systems ( e.g. octopus ( 4 ) , mesa ( 3 ) ) use extracted web tables as a fundamental component . in the database vernacular , a table is defined as a set of tuples which have the same attributes . similarly , a web table is defined as a set of rows ( corresponding to database tuples ) which have the same column headers ( corresponding to database attributes ) . therefore , to extract a web table is to extract a relation on the web . in databases , tables often contain foreign keys which refer to other tables . therefore , it follows that hyperlinks inside a web table sometimes function as foreign keys to other relations whose tuples are contained in the hyperlink 's target pages . in this paper , we explore this idea by asking : can we discover new attributes for web tables by exploring hyperlinks inside web tables ? this poster proposes a solution that takes a web table as input . frequent patterns are generated as new candidate relations by following hyperlinks in the web table . the confidence of candidates are evaluated , and trustworthy candidates are selected to become new attributes for the table . finally , we show the usefulness of our method by performing experiments on a variety of web domains .

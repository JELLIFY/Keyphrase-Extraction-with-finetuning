support feature machine for classification of abnormal brain activity in this study , a novel multidimensional time series classification technique , namely support feature machine ( sfm ) , is proposed . sfm is inspired by the optimization model of support vector machine and the nearest neighbor rule to incorporate both spatial and temporal of the multi-dimensional time series data . this paper also describes an application of sfm for detecting abnormal brain activity . epilepsy is a case in point in this study . in epilepsy studies , electroencephalograms ( eegs ) , acquired in multidimensional time series format , have been traditionally used as a gold-standard tool for capturing the electrical changes in the brain . from multi-dimensional eeg time series data , sfm was used to identify seizure pre-cursors and detect seizure susceptibility ( pre-seizure ) periods . the empirical results showed that sfm achieved over 80 % correct classification of per-seizure eeg on average in 10 patients using 5-fold cross validation . the proposed optimization model of sfm is very compact and scalable , and can be implemented as an online algorithm . the outcome of this study suggests that it is possible to construct a computerized algorithm used to detect seizure pre-cursors and warn of impending seizures through eeg classification .

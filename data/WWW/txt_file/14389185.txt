on directly mapping relational databases to rdf and owl mapping relational databases to rdf is a fundamental problem for the development of the semantic web . we present a solution , inspired by draft methods defined by the w3c where relational databases are directly mapped to rdf and owl . given a relational database schema and its integrity constraints , this direct mapping produces an owl ontology , which , provides the basis for generating rdf instances . the semantics of this mapping is defined using datalog . two fundamental properties are information preservation and query preservation . we prove that our mapping satisfies both conditions , even for relational databases that contain null values . we also consider two desirable properties : monotonicity and semantics preservation . we prove that our mapping is monotone and also prove that no monotone mapping , including ours , is semantic preserving . we realize that monotonicity is an obstacle for semantic preservation and thus present a non-monotone direct mapping that is semantics preserving .

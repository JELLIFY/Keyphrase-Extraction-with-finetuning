extracting data records from the web using tag path clustering fully automatic methods that extract lists of objects from the web have been studied extensively . record extraction , the first step of this object extraction process , identifies a set of web page segments , each of which represents an individual object ( e.g. , a product ) . state-of-the-art methods suffice for simple search , but they often fail to handle more complicated or noisy web page structures due to a key limitation -- their greedy manner of identifying a list of records through pairwise comparison ( i.e. , similarity match ) of consecutive segments . this paper introduces a new method for record extraction that captures a list of objects in a more robust way based on a holistic analysis of a web page . the method focuses on how a distinct tag path appears repeatedly in the dom tree of the web document . instead of comparing a pair of individual segments , it compares a pair of tag path occurrence patterns ( called visual signals ) to estimate how likely these two tag paths represent the same list of objects . the paper introduces a similarity measure that captures how closely the visual signals appear and interleave . clustering of tag paths is then performed based on this similarity measure , and sets of tag paths that form the structure of data records are extracted . experiments show that this method achieves higher accuracy than previous methods .

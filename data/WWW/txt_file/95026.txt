evaluating strategies for similarity search on the web finding pages on the web that are similar to a query page ( related pages ) is an important component of modern search engines . a variety of strategies have been proposed for answering related pages queries , but comparative evaluation by user studies is expensive , especially when large strategy spaces must be searched ( e.g. , when tuning parameters ) . we present a technique for automatically evaluating strategies using web hierarchies , such as open directory , in place of user feedback . we apply this evaluation methodology to a mix of document representation strategies , including the use of text , anchor-text , and links . we discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches examined . finally , we describe how to efficiently construct a similarity index out of our chosen strategies , and provide sample results from our index .

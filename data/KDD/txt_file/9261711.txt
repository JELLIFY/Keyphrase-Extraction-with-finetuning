partial least squares regression for graph mining attributed graphs are increasingly more common in many application domains such as chemistry , biology and text processing . a central issue in graph mining is how to collect informative subgraph patterns for a given learning task . we propose an iterative mining method based on partial least squares regression ( pls ) . to apply pls to graph data , a sparse version of pls is developed first and then it is combined with a weighted pattern mining algorithm . the mining algorithm is iteratively called with different weight vectors , creating one latent component per one mining call . our method , graph pls , is efficient and easy to implement , because the weight vector is updated with elementary matrix calculations . in experiments , our graph pls algorithm showed competitive prediction accuracies in many chemical datasets and its efficiency was significantly superior to graph boosting ( gboost ) and the naive method based on frequent graph mining .

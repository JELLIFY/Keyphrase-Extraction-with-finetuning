weighting versus pruning in rule validation for detecting network and host anomalies for intrusion detection , the lerad algorithm learns a succinct set of comprehensible rules for detecting anomalies , which could be novel attacks . lerad validates the learned rules on a separate held-out validation set and removes rules that cause false alarms . however , removing rules with possible high coverage can lead to missed detections . we propose to retain these rules and associate weights to them . we present three weighting schemes and our empirical results indicate that , for lerad , rule weighting can detect more attacks than pruning with minimal computational overhead .

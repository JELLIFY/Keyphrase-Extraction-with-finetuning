supervised rank aggregation this paper is concerned with rank aggregation , the task of combining the ranking results of individual rankers at meta-search . previously , rank aggregation was performed mainly by means of unsupervised learning . to further enhance ranking accuracies , we propose employing supervised learning to perform the task , using labeled data . we refer to the approach as supervised rank aggregation . we set up a general framework for conducting supervised rank aggregation , in which learning is formalized an optimization which minimizes disagreements between ranking results and the labeled data . as case study , we focus on markov chain based rank aggregation in this paper . the optimization for markov chain based methods is not a convex optimization problem , however , and thus is hard to solve . we prove that we can transform the optimization problem into that of semidefinite programming and solve it efficiently . experimental results on meta-searches show that supervised rank aggregation can significantly outperform existing unsupervised methods .

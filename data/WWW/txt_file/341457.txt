web service interfaces we present a language for specifying web service interfaces . a web service interface puts three kinds of constraints on the users of the service . first , the interface specifies the methods that can be called by a client , together with types of input and output parameters ; these are called signature constraints . second , the interface may specify propositional constraints on method calls and output values that may occur in a web service conversation ; these are called consistency constraints . third , the interface may specify temporal constraints on the ordering of method calls ; these are called protocol constraints . the interfaces can be used to check , first , if two or more web services are compatible , and second , if a web service a can be safely substituted for a web service b. the algorithm for compatibility checking verifies that two or more interfaces fulfill each others ' constraints . the algorithm for substitutivity checking verifies that service a demands fewer and fulfills more constraints than service b.

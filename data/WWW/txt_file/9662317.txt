large scale multi-label classification via metalabeler the explosion of online content has made the management of such content non-trivial . web-related tasks such as web page categorization , news filtering , query categorization , tag recommendation , etc. often involve the construction of multi-label categorization systems on a large scale . existing multi-label classification methods either do not scale or have unsatisfactory performance . in this work , we propose metalabeler to automatically determine the relevant set of labels for each instance without intensive human involvement or expensive cross-validation . extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data show that the metalabeler tends to outperform existing methods . moreover , metalabeler scales to millions of multi-labeled instances and can be deployed easily . this enables us to apply the metalabeler to a large scale query categorization problem in yahoo ! , yielding a significant improvement in performance .

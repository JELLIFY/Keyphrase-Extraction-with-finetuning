balanced allocation with succinct representation motivated by applications in guaranteed delivery in computational advertising , we consider the general problem of balanced allocation in a bipartite supply-demand setting . our formulation captures the notion of deviation from being balanced by a convex penalty function . while this formulation admits a convex programming solution , we strive for more robust and scalable algorithms . for the case of l1 penalty functions we obtain a simple combinatorial algorithm based on min-cost flow in graphs and show how to precompute a linear amount of information such that the allocation along any edge can be approximated in constant time . we then extend our combinatorial solution to any convex function by solving a convex cost flow . these scalable methods may have applications in other contexts stipulating balanced allocation . we study the performance of our algorithms on large real-world graphs and show that they are efficient , scalable , and robust in practice .

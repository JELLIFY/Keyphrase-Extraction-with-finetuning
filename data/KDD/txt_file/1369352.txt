mining heterogeneous gene expression data with time lagged recurrent neural networks heterogeneous types of gene expressions may provide a better insight into the biological role of gene interaction with the environment , disease development and drug effect at the molecular level . in this paper for both exploring and prediction purposes a time lagged recurrent neural network with trajectory learning is proposed for identifying and classifying the gene functional patterns from the heterogeneous nonlinear time series microarray experiments . the proposed procedures identify gene functional patterns from the dynamics of a state-trajectory learned in the heterogeneous time series and the gradient information over time . also , the trajectory learning with back-propagation through time algorithm can recognize gene expression patterns vary over time . this may reveal much more information about the regulatory network underlying gene expressions . the analyzed data were extracted from spotted dna microarrays in the budding yeast expression measurements , produced by eisen et al. . the gene matrix contained 79 experiments over a variety of heterogeneous experiment conditions . the number of recognized gene patterns in our study ranged from two to ten and were divided into three cases . optimal network architectures with different memory structures were selected based on akaike and bayesian information statistical criteria using two-way factorial design . the optimal model performance was compared to other popular gene classification algorithms such as nearest neighbor , support vector machine , and self-organized map . the reliability of the performance was verified with multiple iterated runs .

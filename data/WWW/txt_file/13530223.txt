searching for events in the blogosphere over the last few years , blogs ( web logs ) have gained massive popularity and have become one of the most influential web social media in our times . every blog post in the blogosphere has a well defined timestamp , which is not taken into account by search engines . by conducting research regarding this feature of the blogosphere , we can attempt to discover bursty terms and correlations between them during a time interval . we apply kleinberg 's automaton on extracted titles of blog posts to discover bursty terms , we introduce a novel representation of a term 's burstiness evolution called state series and we employ a euclidean-based distance metric to discover potential correlations between terms without taking into account their context . we evaluate the results trying to match them with real life events . finally , we propose some ideas for further evaluation techniques and future research in the field .

estimating the impressionrank of web pages the impressionrank of a web page ( or , more generally , of a web site ) is the number of times users viewed the page while browsing search results . impressionrank captures the visibility of pages and sites in search engines and is thus an important measure , which is of interest to web site owners , competitors , market analysts , and end users . all previous approaches to estimating the impressionrank of a page rely on privileged access to private data sources , like the search engine 's query log . in this paper we present the first external algorithm for estimating the impressionrank of a web page . this algorithm relies on access to three public data sources : the search engine , the query suggestion service of the search engine , and the web . in addition , the algorithm is local and uses modest resources . it can therefore be used by almost any party to estimate the impressionrank of any page on any search engine . en route to estimating the impressionrank of a page , our algorithm solves a novel variant of the keyword extraction problem : it finds the most popular search keywords that drive impressions of a page . empirical analysis of the algorithm on the google and yahoo ! search engines indicates that it is accurate and provides interesting insights about sites and search queries .

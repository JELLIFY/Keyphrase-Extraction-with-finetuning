scad : collective discovery of attribute values search engines today offer a rich user experience , no longer restricted to `` ten blue links '' . for example , the query `` canon eos digital camera '' returns a photo of the digital camera , and a list of suitable merchants and prices . similar results are offered in other domains like food , entertainment , travel , etc. . all these experiences are fueled by the availability of structured data about the entities of interest . to obtain this structured data , it is necessary to solve the following problem : given a category of entities with its schema , and a set of web pages that mention and describe entities belonging to the category , build a structured representation for the entity under the given schema . specifically , collect structured numerical or discrete attributes of the entities . most previous approaches regarded this as an information extraction problem on individual documents , and made no special use of numerical attributes . in contrast , we present an end-to-end framework which leverages signals not only from the web page context , but also from a collective analysis of all the pages corresponding to an entity , and from constraints related to the actual values within the domain . our current implementation uses a general and flexible integer linear program ( ilp ) to integrate all these signals into holistic decisions over all attributes . there is one ilp per entity and it is small enough to be solved in under 38 milliseconds in our experiments . we apply the new framework to a setting of significant practical importance : catalog expansion for commerce search engines , using data from bing shopping . finally , we present experiments that validate the effectiveness of the framework and its superiority to local extraction .

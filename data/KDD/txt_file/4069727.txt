fast discovery of unexpected patterns in data , relative to a bayesian network we consider a model in which background knowledge on a given domain of interest is available in terms of a bayesian network , in addition to a large database . the mining problem is to discover unexpected patterns : our goal is to find the strongest discrepancies between network and database . this problem is intrinsically difficult because it requires inference in a bayesian network and processing the entire , potentially very large , database . a sampling-based method that we introduce is efficient and yet provably finds the approximately most interesting unexpected patterns . we give a rigorous proof of the method 's correctness . experiments shed light on its efficiency and practicality for large-scale bayesian networks and databases .

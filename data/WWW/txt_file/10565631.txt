mind the data skew : distributed inferencing by speeddating in elastic regions semantic web data exhibits very skewed frequency distributions among terms . efficient large-scale distributed reasoning methods should maintain load-balance in the face of such highly skewed distribution of input data . we show that term-based partitioning , used by most distributed reasoning approaches , has limited scalability due to load-balancing problems . we address this problem with a method for data distribution based on clustering in elastic regions . instead of as - signing data to fixed peers , data flows semi-randomly in the network . data items `` speed-date '' while being temporarily collocated in the same peer . we introduce a bias in the routing to allow semantically clustered neighborhoods to emerge . our approach is self-organising , efficient and does not require any central coordination . we have implemented this method on the marvin platform and have performed experiments on large real-world datasets , using a cluster of up to 64 nodes . we compute the rdfs closure over different datasets and show that our clustering algorithm drastically reduces computation time , calculating the rdfs closure of 200 million triples in 7.2 minutes .

crawling multiple uddi business registries as web services proliferate , size and magnitude of uddi business registries ( ubrs ) are likely to increase . the ability to discover web services of interest then across multiple ubrs becomes a major challenge specially when using primitive search methods provided by existing uddi apis . clients do not have the time to endlessly search accessible ubrs for finding appropriate services particularly when operating via mobile devices . finding services of interest should be time effective and highly productive . this paper addresses issues relating to the efficient access and discovery of web services across multiple ubrs and introduces a novel exploration engine , the web service crawler engine ( wsce ) . wsce is capable of crawling multiple ubrs , and enables for the establishment of a centralized web services repository that can be used for discovering web services much more efficiently . the paper presents experimental validation , results , and analysis of the proposed ideas .

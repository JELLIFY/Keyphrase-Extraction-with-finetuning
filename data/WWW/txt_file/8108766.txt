generative models for name disambiguation name ambiguity is a special case of identity uncertainty where one person can be referenced by multiple name variations in different situations or evenshare the same name with other people . in this paper , we present an efficient framework by using two novel topic-based models , extended from probabilistic latent semantic analysis ( plsa ) and latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) . our models explicitly introduce a new variable for persons and learn the distribution of topics with regard to persons and words . experiments indicate that our approach consistently outperforms other unsupervised methods including spectral and dbscan clustering . scalability is addressed by disambiguating authors in over 750,000 papers from the entire citeseer dataset .

secubat : a web vulnerability scanner as the popularity of the web increases and web applications become tools of everyday use , the role of web security has been gaining importance as well . the last years have shown a significant increase in the number of web-based attacks . for example , there has been extensive press coverage of recent security incidences involving the loss of sensitive credit card information belonging to millions of customers . many web application security vulnerabilities result from generic input validation problems . examples of such vulnerabilities are sql injection and cross-site scripting ( xss ) . although the majority of web vulnerabilities are easy to understand and to avoid , many web developers are , unfortunately , not security-aware . as a result , there exist many web sites on the internet that are vulnerable . this paper demonstrates how easy it is for attackers to automatically discover and exploit application-level vulnerabilities in a large number of web applications . to this end , we developed secubat , a generic and modular web vulnerability scanner that , similar to a port scanner , automatically analyzes web sites with the aim of finding exploitable sql injection and xss vulnerabilities . using secubat , we were able to find many potentially vulnerable web sites . to verify the accuracy of secubat , we picked one hundred interesting web sites from the potential victim list for further analysis and confirmed exploitable flaws in the identified web pages . among our victims were well-known global companies and a finance ministry . of course , we notified the administrators of vulnerable sites about potential security problems . more than fifty responded to request additional information or to report that the security hole was closed .

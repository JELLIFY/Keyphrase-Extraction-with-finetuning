living the tv revolution : unite mhp to the web or face idtv irrelevance ! the union of interactive digital tv ( idtv ) and web promotes the development of new interactive multimedia services , enjoyable while watching tv even on the new handheld digital tv receivers . yet , several design constraints complicate the deployment of this new pattern of services . indeed , for a suitable presentation on a tv set , web contents must be structured in such a way that they can be effectively displayed on tv screens via low-end set top boxes ( stbs ) . moreover , usable interfaces for idtv platforms are needed which ensure a smooth access to contents . our claim is that the distribution of web contents over the idtv broadcast channels may bring idtv to a new life . a failure of this attempt may put idtv on a progressive track towards irrelevance . we propose a system for the distribution of web contents towards idtv under the digital video broadcasting - multimedia home platform ( dvb-mhp ) standard . our system is able to automatically transcode web contents and ensure a proper visualization on idtv . the system is endowed with a client application which permits to easily browse contents on the tv via a remote control . real assessments have confirmed the effectiveness for such an automatic online service able to reconfigure web contents for an appropriate distribution and presentation on idtv .

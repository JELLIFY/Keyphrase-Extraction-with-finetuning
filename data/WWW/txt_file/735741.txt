webcap : a capacity planning tool for web resource management a staggering number of multimedia applications are being introduced every day . yet , the inordinate delays encountered in retrieving multimedia documents make it difficult to use the web for real-time applications such as educational broadcasting , video conferencing , and multimedia streaming . the problem of delivering multimedia documents in time while placing the least demands on the client , network and server resources is a challenging optimization problem . the webcap is ongoing project that explores applying capacity planning techniques to manage or tune the web resources ( client , network , server ) for optimal or near optimal performance , subject to minimizing the retrieval cost while satisfying the real-time constraints and available resources . the webcap project consists of four software modules : object extractor , object representer , object scheduler , and system tuner . the four modules are connected serially with 3 feedback-loops . in this paper , we focus on how to extract objects from multimedia document and how to represent them as object and operation flow graphs while maintaining precedence relations among the objects .

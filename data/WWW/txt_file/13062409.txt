low-infrastructure methods to improve internet access for mobile users in emerging regions as information technology supports more aspects of modern life , digital access has become an important tool for developing regions to lift themselves from poverty . though broadband internet connectivity will not be universally available in the short-term , widely-employed mobile devices coupled with novel delay-tolerant networking do allow limited forms of connectivity . this paper explores the design space for internet access systems operating with constrained connectivity . our starting point is c-link , a collaborative caching system that enhances the performance of interactive web access over dtn and cellular connectivity . we discuss our experiences and results from deploying c-link in nicaragua , before moving on to a broader design study of other issues that further influence operation . we consider the impact of ( i ) storing web content collaboratively cached across all user nodes , ( ii ) hybrid transport layers exploiting the best attributes of limited cellular and dtn-style connectivity . we also explore the behavior of future systems under a range of usage and mobility scenarios . even under adverse conditions , our techniques can improve average service latency for page requests by a factor of 2x . our results point to the considerable power of leveraging user mobility and collaboration in providing very-low-infrastructure internet access to developing regions .

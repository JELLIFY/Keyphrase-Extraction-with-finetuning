cataclysm : policing extreme overloads in internet applications in this paper we present the cataclysm server platform for handling extreme overloads in hosted internet applications . the primary contribution of our work is to develop a low overhead , highly scalable admission control technique for internet applications . cataclysm provides several desirable features , such as guarantees on response time by conducting accurate size-based admission control , revenue maximization at multiple time-scales via preferential admission of important requests and dynamic capacity provisioning , and the ability to be operational even under extreme overloads . cataclysm can transparently trade-off the accuracy of its decision making with the intensity of the workload allowing it to handle incoming rates of several tens of thousands of requests\/second . we implement a prototype cataclysm hosting platform on a linux cluster and demonstrate the benefits of our integrated approach using a variety of workloads .

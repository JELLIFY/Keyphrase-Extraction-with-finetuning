summarizing email conversations with clue words accessing an ever increasing number of emails , possibly on small mobile devices , has become a major problem for many users . email summarization is a promising way to solve this problem . in this paper , we propose a new framework for email summarization . one novelty is to use a fragment quotation graph to try to capture an email conversation . the second novelty is to use clue words to measure the importance of sentences in conversation summarization . based on clue words and their scores , we propose a method called cws , which is capable of producing a summary of any length as requested by the user . we provide a comprehensive comparison of cws with various existing methods on the enron data set . preliminary results suggest that cws provides better summaries than existing methods .

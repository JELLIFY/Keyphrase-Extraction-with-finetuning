groupme ! this paper presents the groupme ! system , a resource sharing system with advanced tagging functionality . groupme ! provides a novel user interface , which enables users to organize and arrange arbitrary web resources into groups . the content of such groups can be overlooked and inspected immediately as resources are visualized in a multimedia-based fashion . in this paper , we furthermore introduce new folksonomy-based ranking strategies that exploit the group structure shipped with groupme ! folksonomies . experiments show that those strategies significantly improve the performance of such ranking algorithms .

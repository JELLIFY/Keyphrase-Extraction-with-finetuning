cfi-stream : mining closed frequent itemsets in data streams mining frequent closed itemsets provides complete and condensed information for non-redundant association rules generation . extensive studies have been done on mining frequent closed itemsets , but they are mainly intended for traditional transaction databases and thus do not take data stream characteristics into consideration . in this paper , we propose a novel approach for mining closed frequent itemsets over data streams . it computes and maintains closed itemsets online and incrementally , and can output the current closed frequent itemsets in real time based on users ' specified thresholds . experimental results show that our proposed method is both time and space efficient , has good scalability as the number of transactions processed increases and adapts very rapidly to the change in data streams .

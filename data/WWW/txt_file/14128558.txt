using proximity to predict activity in social networks the structure of a social network contains information useful for predicting its evolution . we show that structural information also helps predict activity . people who are `` close '' in some sense in a social network are more likely to perform similar actions than more distant people . we use network proximity to capture the degree to which people are `` close '' to each other . in addition to standard proximity metrics used in the link prediction task , such as neighborhood overlap , we introduce new metrics that model different types of interactions that take place between people . we study this claim empirically using data about url forwarding activity on the social media sites digg and twitter . we show that structural proximity of two users in the follower graph is related to similarity of their activity , i.e. , how many urls they both forward . we also show that given friends ' activity , knowing their proximity to the user can help better predict which urls the user will forward . we compare the performance of different proximity metrics on the activity prediction task and find that metrics that take into account the attention-limited nature of interactions in social media lead to substantially better predictions .

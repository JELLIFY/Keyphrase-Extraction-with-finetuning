constructing folksonomies from user-specified relations on flickr automatic folksonomy construction from tags has attracted much attention recently . however , inferring hierarchical relations between concepts from tags has a drawback in that it is difficult to distinguish between more popular and more general concepts . instead of tags we propose to use user-specified relations for learning folksonomy . we explore two statistical frameworks for aggregating many shallow individual hierarchies , expressed through the collection\/set relations on the social photosharing site flickr , into a common deeper folksonomy that reflects how a community organizes knowledge . our approach addresses a number of challenges that arise while aggregating information from diverse users , namely noisy vocabulary , and variations in the granularity level of the concepts expressed . our second contribution is a method for automatically evaluating learned folksonomy by comparing it to a reference taxonomy , e.g. , the web directory created by the open directory project . our empirical results suggest that user-specified relations are a good source of evidence for learning folksonomies .

an axiomatic approach for result diversification understanding user intent is key to designing an effective ranking system in a search engine . in the absence of any explicit knowledge of user intent , search engines want to diversify results to improve user satisfaction . in such a setting , the probability ranking principle-based approach of presenting the most relevant results on top can be sub-optimal , and hence the search engine would like to trade-off relevance for diversity in the results . in analogy to prior work on ranking and clustering systems , we use the axiomatic approach to characterize and design diversification systems . we develop a set of natural axioms that a diversification system is expected to satisfy , and show that no diversification function can satisfy all the axioms simultaneously . we illustrate the use of the axiomatic framework by providing three example diversification objectives that satisfy different subsets of the axioms . we also uncover a rich link to the facility dispersion problem that results in algorithms for a number of diversification objectives . finally , we propose an evaluation methodology to characterize the objectives and the underlying axioms . we conduct a large scale evaluation of our objectives based on two data sets : a data set derived from the wikipedia disambiguation pages and a product database .

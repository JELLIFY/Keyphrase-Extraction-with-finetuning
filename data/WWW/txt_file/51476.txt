super-peer-based routing and clustering strategies for rdf-based peer-to-peer networks rdf-based p2p networks have a number of advantages compared with simpler p2p networks such as napster , gnutella or with approaches based on distributed indices such as can and chord . rdf-based p2p networks allow complex and extendable descriptions of resources instead of fixed and limited ones , and they provide complex query facilities against these metadata instead of simple keyword-based searches . in previous papers , we have described the edutella infrastructure and different kinds of edutella peers implementing such an rdf-based p2p network . in this paper we will discuss these rdf-based p2p networks as a specific example of a new type of p2p networks , schema-based p2p networks , and describe the use of super-peer based topologies for these networks . super-peer based networks can provide better scalability than broadcast based networks , and do provide perfect support for inhomogeneous schema-based networks , which support different metadata schemas and ontologies ( crucial for the semantic web ) . furthermore , as we will show in this paper , they are able to support sophisticated routing and clustering strategies based on the metadata schemas , attributes and ontologies used . especially helpful in this context is the rdf functionality to uniquely identify schemas , attributes and ontologies . the resulting routing indices can be built using dynamic frequency counting algorithms and support local mediation and transformation rules , and we will sketch some first ideas for implementing these advanced functionalities as well .

first-order focused crawling this paper reports a new general framework of focused web crawling based on `` relational subgroup discovery '' . predicates are used explicitly to represent the relevance clues of those unvisited pages in the crawl frontier , and then first-order classification rules are induced using subgroup discovery technique . the learned relational rules with sufficient support and confidence will guide the crawling process afterwards . we present the many interesting features of our proposed first-order focused crawler , together with preliminary promising experimental results .

u-rest : an unsupervised record extraction system in this paper , we describe a system that can extract recordstructures from web pages with no direct human supervision . records are commonly occurring html-embedded data tuples that describe people , offered courses , products , company profiles , etc. . we present a simplified frameworkfor studying the problem of unsupervised record extraction . one which separates the algorithms from the feature engineering . our system , u-rest formalizes an approach tothe problem of unsupervised record extraction using a simple two-stage machine learning framework . the first stage involves clustering , where structurally similar regions are discovered , and the second stage involves classification , where discovered groupings ( clusters of regions ) are ranked by their likelihood of being records . in our work , we describe , and summarize the results of an extensive survey of features for both stages . we conclude by comparing u-rest to related systems . the results of our empirical evaluation show encouraging improvements in extraction accuracy .

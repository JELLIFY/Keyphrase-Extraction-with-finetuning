summarizing itemset patterns using probabilistic models in this paper , we propose a novel probabilistic approach to summarize frequent itemset patterns . such techniques are useful for summarization , post-processing , and end-user interpretation , particularly for problems where the resulting set of patterns are huge . in our approach items in the dataset are modeled as random variables . we then construct a markov random fields ( mrf ) on these variables based on frequent itemsets and their occurrence statistics . the summarization proceeds in a level-wise iterative fashion . occurrence statistics of itemsets at the lowest level are used to construct an initial mrf . statistics of itemsets at the next level can then be inferred from the model . we use those patterns whose occurrence can not be accurately inferred from the model to augment the model in an iterative manner , repeating the procedure until all frequent itemsets can be modeled . the resulting mrf model affords a concise and useful representation of the original collection of itemsets . extensive empirical study on real datasets show that the new approach can effectively summarize a large number of itemsets and typically significantly outperforms extant approaches .

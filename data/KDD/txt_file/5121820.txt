efficient incremental constrained clustering clustering with constraints is an emerging area of data mining research . however , most work assumes that the constraints are given as one large batch . in this paper we explore the situation where the constraints are incrementally given . in this way the user after seeing a clustering can provide positive and negative feedback via constraints to critique a clustering solution . we consider the problem of efficiently updating a clustering to satisfy the new and old constraints rather than reclustering the entire data set . we show that the problem of incremental clustering under constraints is np-hard in general , but identify several sufficient conditions which lead to efficiently solvable versions . these translate into a set of rules on the types of constraints thatcan be added and constraint set properties that must be maintained . we demonstrate that this approach is more efficient than re-clustering the entire data set and has several other advantages .

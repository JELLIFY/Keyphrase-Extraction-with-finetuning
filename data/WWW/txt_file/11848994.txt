growing parallel paths for entity-page discovery in this paper , we use the structural and relational information on the web to find entity-pages . specifically , given a web site and an entity-page ( e.g. , department and faculty member homepage ) we seek to find all of the entity-pages of the same type ( e.g. , all faculty members in the department ) . to do this , we propose a web structure mining method which grows parallel paths through the web graph and dom trees . we show that by utilizing these parallel paths we can efficiently discover all entity-pages of the same type . finally , we demonstrate the accuracy of our method with a case study on various domains .

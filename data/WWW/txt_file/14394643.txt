recommendations to boost content spread in social networks content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering content on the internet . the degree to which content is disseminated within the network depends on the connectivity relationships among network nodes . existing schemes for recommending connections in social networks are based on the number of common neighbors , similarity of user profiles , etc. . however , such similarity-based connections do not consider the amount of content discovered . in this paper , we propose novel algorithms for recommending connections that boost content propagation in a social network without compromising on the relevance of the recommendations . unlike existing work on influence propagation , in our environment , we are looking for edges instead of nodes , with a bound on the number of incident edges per node . we show that the content spread function is not submodular , and develop approximation algorithms for computing a near-optimal set of edges . through experiments on real-world social graphs such as flickr and twitter , we show that our approximation algorithms achieve content spreads that are as much as 90 times higher compared to existing heuristics for recommending connections .

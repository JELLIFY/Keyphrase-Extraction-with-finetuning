a pruning-based approach for supporting top-k join queries an important issue arising from large scale data integration is how to efficiently select the top-k ranking answers from multiple sources while minimizing the transmission cost . this paper resolves this issue by proposing an efficient pruning-based approach to answer top-k join queries . the total amount of transmitted data can be greatly reduced by pruning tuples that can not produce the desired join results with a rank value greater than or equal to the rank value generated so far .

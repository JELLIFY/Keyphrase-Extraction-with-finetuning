coherent closed quasi-clique discovery from large dense graph databases frequent coherent subgraphs can provide valuable knowledge about the underlying internal structure of a graph database , and mining frequently occurring coherent subgraphs from large dense graph databases has been witnessed several applications and received considerable attention in the graph mining community recently . in this paper , we study how to efficiently mine the complete set of coherent closed quasi-cliques from large dense graph databases , which is an especially challenging task due to the downward-closure property no longer holds . by fully exploring some properties of quasi-cliques , we propose several novel optimization techniques , which can prune the unpromising and redundant sub-search spaces effectively . meanwhile , we devise an efficient closure checking scheme to facilitate the discovery of only closed quasi-cliques . we also develop a coherent closed quasi-clique mining algorithm , ( b ) cocain ( \/ b ) 1 thorough performance study shows that cocain is very efficient and scalable for large dense graph databases .

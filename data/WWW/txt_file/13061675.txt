filtering microblogging messages for social tv social tv was named one of the ten most important emerging technologies in 2010 by the mit technology review . manufacturers of set-top boxes and televisions have recently started to integrate access to social networks into their products . some of these systems allow users to read microblogging messages related to the tv program they are currently watching . however , such systems suffer from low precision and recall when they use the title of the show as keywords when retrieving messages , without any additional filtering . we propose a bootstrapping approach to collecting microblogging messages related to a given tv program . we start with a small set of annotated data , in which , for a given show and a candidate message , we annotate the pair to be relevant or irrelevant . from this annotated data set , we train an initial classifier . the features are designed to capture the association between the tv program and the message . using our initial classifier and a large dataset of unlabeled messages we derive broader features for a second classifier to further improve precision .

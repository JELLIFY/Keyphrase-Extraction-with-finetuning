crosslanguage blog mining and trend visualisation people use weblogs to express thoughts , present ideas and share knowledge , therefore weblogs are extraordinarily valuable resources , amongs others , for trend analysis . trends are derived from the chronological sequence of blog post count per topic . the comparison with a reference corpus allows qualitative statements over identified trends . we propose a crosslanguage blog mining and trend visualisation system to analyze blogs across languages and topics . the trend visualisation facilitates the identification of trends and the comparison with the reference news article corpus . to prove the correctness of our system we computed the correlation between trends in blogs and news articles for a subset of blogs and topics . the evaluation corroborated our hypothesis of a high correlation coefficient for these subsets and therefore the correctness of our system for different languages and topics is proven .

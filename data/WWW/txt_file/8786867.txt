semantic email this paper investigates how the vision of the semantic web can be carried overto the realm of email . we introduce a general notion of semantice mail , in which an email message consists of an rdf query or update coupled with corresponding explanatory text . semantic email opens the door to a wide range of automated , email-mediated applications with formally guaranteed properties . in particular , this paper introduces a broad class of semantic email processes . for example consider the process of sending an email to a program committee asking who will attend the pc dinner automatically collecting the responses and tallying them up . we define bothlogical and decision-theoretic models where an email process ismodeled as a set of updates to a data set on which we specify goals via certain constraints or utilities . we then describe a set ofinference problems that arise while trying to satisfy these goals and analyze their computational tractability . in particular weshow that for the logical model it is possible to automatically infer which email responses are acceptable w.r.t. a set ofconstraints in polynomial time and for the decision-theoreticmodel it is possible to compute the optimal message-handling policy in polynomial time . finally we discuss our publicly available implementation of semantic email and outline research challenges inthis realm .

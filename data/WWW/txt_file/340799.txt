anti-aliasing on the web it is increasingly common for users to interact with the web using a number of different aliases . this trend is a double-edged sword . on one hand , it is a fundamental building block in approaches to online privacy . on the other hand , there are economic and social consequences to allowing each user an arbitrary number of free aliases . thus , there is great interest in understanding the fundamental issues in obscuring the identities behind aliases . however , most work in the area has focused on linking aliases through analysis of lower-level properties of interactions such as network routes . we show that aliases that actively post text on the web can be linked together through analysis of that text . we study a large number of users posting on bulletin boards , and develop algorithms to anti-alias those users : we can with a high degree of success identify when two aliases belong to the same individual . our results show that such techniques are surprisingly effective , leading us to conclude that guaranteeing privacy among aliases that post actively requires mechanisms that do not yet exist .

a fault model and mutation testing of access control policies to increase confidence in the correctness of specified policies , policy developers can conduct policy testing by supplying typical test inputs ( requests ) and subsequently checking test outputs ( responses ) against expected ones . unfortunately , manual testing is tedious and few tools exist for automated testing of access control policies . we present a fault model for access control policies and a framework to explore it . the framework includes mutation operators used to implement the fault model , mutant generation , equivalent-mutant detection , and mutant-killing determination . this framework allows us to investigate our fault model , evaluate coverage criteria for test generation and selection , and determine a relationship between structural coverage and fault-detection effectiveness . we have implemented the framework and applied it to various policies written in xacml . our experimental results offer valuable insights into choosing mutation operators in mutation testing and choosing coverage criteria in test generation and selection .

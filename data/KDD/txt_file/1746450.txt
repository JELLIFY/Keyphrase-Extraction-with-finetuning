robust space transformations for distance-based operations for many kdd operations , such as nearest neighbor search , distance-based clustering , and outlier detection , there is an underlying & kgr ;-d data space in which each tuple\/object is represented as a point in the space . in the presence of differing scales , variability , correlation , and\/or outliers , we may get unintuitive results if an inappropriate space is used . the fundamental question that this paper addresses is : `` what then is an appropriate space ? '' we propose using a robust space transformation called the donoho-stahel estimator . in the first half of the paper , we show the key properties of the estimator . of particular importance to kdd applications involving databases is the stability property , which says that in spite of frequent updates , the estimator does not : ( a ) change much , ( b ) lose its usefulness , or ( c ) require re-computation . in the second half , we focus on the computation of the estimator for high-dimensional databases . we develop randomized algorithms and evaluate how well they perform empirically . the novel algorithm we develop called the hybrid-random algorithm is , in most cases , at least an order of magnitude faster than the fixed-angle and subsampling algorithms .

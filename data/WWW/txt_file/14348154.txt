leveraging interlingual classification to improve web search in this paper we address the problem of improving accuracy of web search in a smaller , data-limited search market ( search language ) using behavioral data from a larger , data-rich market ( assist language ) . specifically , we use interlingual classification to infer the search language query 's intent using the assist language click-through data . we use these improved estimates of query intent , along with the query intent based on the search language data , to compute features that encode the similarity between a search result ( url ) and the query . these features are subsequently fed into the ranking model to improve the relevance ranking of the documents . our experimental results on german and french languages show the effectiveness of using assist language behavioral data especially , when the search language queries have small click-through data .

learning and inferencing in user ontology for personalized semantic web services domain ontology has been used in many semantic web applications . however , few applications explore the use of ontology for personalized services . this paper proposes an ontology based user model consisting of both concepts and semantic relations to represent users ' interests . specifically , we adopt a statistical approach to learning a semantic-based user ontology model from domain ontology and a spreading activation procedure for inferencing in the user ontology model . we apply the methods of learning and exploiting user ontology to a semantic search engine for finding academic publications . our experimental results support the efficacy of user ontology and spreading activation theory ( sat ) for providing personalized semantic services .

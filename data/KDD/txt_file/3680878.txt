selection , combination , and evaluation of effective software sensors for detecting abnormal computer usage we present and empirically analyze a machine-learning approach for detecting intrusions on individual computers . our winnow-based algorithm continually monitors user and system behavior , recording such properties as the number of bytes transferred over the last 10 seconds , the programs that currently are running , and the load on the cpu . in all , hundreds of measurements are made and analyzed each second . using this data , our algorithm creates a model that represents each particular computer 's range of normal behavior . parameters that determine when an alarm should be raised , due to abnormal activity , are set on a per-computer basis , based on an analysis of training data . a major issue in intrusion-detection systems is the need for very low false-alarm rates . our empirical results suggest that it is possible to obtain high intrusion-detection rates ( 95 % ) and low false-alarm rates ( less than one per day per computer ) , without `` stealing '' too many cpu cycles ( less than 1 % ) . we also report which system measurements are the most valuable in terms of detecting intrusions . a surprisingly large number of different measurements prove significantly useful .

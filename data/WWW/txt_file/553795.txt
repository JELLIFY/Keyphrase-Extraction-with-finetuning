trust-serv : model-driven lifecycle management of trust negotiation policies for web services a scalable approach to trust negotiation is required in web service environments that have large and dynamic requester populations . we introduce trust-serv , a model-driven trust negotiation framework for web services . the framework employs a model for trust negotiation that is based on state machines , extended with security abstractions . our policy model supports lifecycle management , an important trait in the dynamic environments that characterize web services . in particular , we provide a set of change operations to modify policies , and migration strategies that permit ongoing negotiations to be migrated to new policies without being disrupted . experimental results show the performance benefit of these strategies . the proposed approach has been implemented as a container-centric mechanism that is transparent to the web services and to the developers of web services , simplifying web service development and management as well as enabling scalable deployments .

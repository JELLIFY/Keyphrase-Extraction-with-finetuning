partitioned logistic regression for spam filtering naive bayes and logistic regression perform well in different regimes . while the former is a very simple generative model which is efficient to train and performs well empirically in many applications , the latter is a discriminative model which often achieves better accuracy and can be shown to outperform naive bayes asymptotically . in this paper , we propose a novel hybrid model , partitioned logistic regression , which has several advantages over both naive bayes and logistic regression . this model separates the original feature space into several disjoint feature groups . individual models on these groups of features are learned using logistic regression and their predictions are combined using the naive bayes principle to produce a robust final estimation . we show that our model is better both theoretically and empirically . in addition , when applying it in a practical application , email spam filtering , it improves the normalized auc score at 10 % false-positive rate by 28.8 % and 23.6 % compared to naive bayes and logistic regression , when using the exact same training examples .

meteor : metadata and instance extraction from object referral lists on the web the web has established itself as the largest public data repository ever available . even though the vast majority of information on the web is formatted to be easily readable by the human eye , `` meaningful information '' is still largely inaccessible for the computer applications . in this paper we present the meteor system which utilizes various presentation and linkage regularities from referral lists of various sorts to automatically separate and extract metadata and instance information . experimental results for the university domain with 12 computer science department web sites , comprising 361 individual faculty and course home pages indicate that the performance of the metadata and instance extraction averages 85 % , 88 % f-measure respectively . meteor achieves this performance without any domain specific engineering requirement .

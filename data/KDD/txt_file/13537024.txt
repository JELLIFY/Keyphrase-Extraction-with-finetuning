toward autonomic grids : analyzing the job flow with affinity streaming the affinity propagation ( ap ) clustering algorithm proposed by frey and dueck ( 2007 ) provides an understandable , nearly optimal summary of a dataset , albeit with quadratic computational complexity . this paper , motivated by autonomic computing , extends ap to the data streaming framework . firstly a hierarchical strategy is used to reduce the complexity to o ( n1 + Îµ ) ; the distortion loss incurred is analyzed in relation with the dimension of the data items . secondly , a coupling with a change detection test is used to cope with non-stationary data distribution , and rebuild the model as needed . the presented approach strap is applied to the stream of jobs submitted to the egee grid , providing an understandable description of the job flow and enabling the system administrator to spot online some sources of failures .

a graphical user interface toolkit approach to thin-client computing network and server-centric computing paradigms are quickly returning to being the dominant methods by which we use computers . web applications are so prevalent that the role of a pc today has been largely reduced to a terminal for running a client or viewer such as a web browser . implementers of network-centric applications typically rely on the limited capabilities of html , employing proprietary `` plug ins '' or transmitting the binary image of an entire application that will be executed on the client . alternatively , implementers can develop without regard for remote use , requiring users who wish to run such applications on a remote server to rely on a system that creates a virtual frame buffer on the server , and transmits a copy of its raster image to the local client . we review some of the problems that these current approaches pose , and show how they can be solved by developing a distributed user interface toolkit . a distributed user interface toolkit applies techniques to the high level components of a toolkit that are similar to those used at a low level in the x window system . as an example of this approach , we present remotejfc , a working distributed user interface toolkit that makes it possible to develop thin-client applications using a distributed version of the java foundation classes .

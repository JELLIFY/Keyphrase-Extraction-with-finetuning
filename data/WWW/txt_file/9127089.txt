a unified framework for name disambiguation name ambiguity problem has been a challenging issue for a long history . in this paper , we intend to make a thorough investigation of the whole problem . specifically , we formalize the name disambiguation problem in a unified framework . the framework can incorporate both attribute and relationship into a probabilistic model . we explore a dynamic approach for automatically estimating the person number k and employ an adaptive distance measure to estimate the distance between objects . experimental results show that our proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline method .

network-aware forward caching this paper proposes and evaluates a network aware forward caching approach for determining the optimal deployment strategy of forward caches to a network . a key advantage of this approach is that we can reduce the network costs associated with forward caching to maximize the benefit obtained from their deployment . we show in our simulation that a 37 % increase to net benefits could be achieved over the standard method of full cache deployment to cache all pops traffic . in addition , we show that this maximal point occurs when only 68 % of the total traffic is cached . another contribution of this paper is the analysis we use to motivate and evaluate this problem . we characterize the internet traffic of 100k subscribers of a us residential broadband provider . we use both layer 4 and layer 7 analysis to investigate the traffic volumes of the flows as well as study the general characteristics of the applications used . we show that http is a dominant protocol and account for 68 % of the total downstream traffic and that 34 % of that traffic is multimedia . in addition , we show that multimedia content using http exhibits a 83 % annualized growth rate and other http traffic has a 53 % growth rate versus the 26 % over all annual growth rate of broadband traffic . this shows that http traffic will become ever more dominent and increase the potential caching opportunities . furthermore , we characterize the core backbone traffic of this broadband provider to measure the distance traveled by content and traffic . we find that cdn traffic is much more efficient than p2p content and that there is large skew in the air miles between pop in a typical network . our findings show that there are many opportunties in broadband provider networks to optimize how traffic is delivered and cached .

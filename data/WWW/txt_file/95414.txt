semantic web support for the business-to-business e-commerce lifecycle if an e-services approach to electronic commerce is to become widespread , standardisation of ontologies , message content and message protocols will be necessary . in this paper , we present a lifecycle of a business-to-business e-commerce interaction , and show how the semantic web can support a service description language that can be used throughout this lifecycle . by using daml , we develop a service description language sufficiently expressive and flexible to be used not only in advertisements , but also in matchmaking queries , negotiation proposals and agreements . we also identify which operations must be carried out on this description language if the b2b lifecycle is to be fully supported . we do not propose specific standard protocols , but instead argue that our operators are able to support a wide variety of interaction protocols , and so will be fundamental irrespective of which protocols are finally adopted .

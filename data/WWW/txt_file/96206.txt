visualising student tracking data to support instructors in web-based distance education this paper presents a novel approach of using web log data generated by course management systems ( cms ) to help instructors become aware of what is happening in distance learning classes . specifically , techniques from information visualization are used to graphically render complex , multidimensional student tracking data collected by cms . a system , called coursevis , illustrates the proposed approach . graphical representations from the use of coursevis to visualise data from a java on-line distance course ran with webct are presented . findings from the evaluation of coursevis are presented , and it is argued that coursevis can help teachers become aware of some social , behavioural , and cognitive aspects related to distance learners . using graphical representations of student tracking data , instructors can identify tendencies in their classes , or quickly discover individuals that need special attention .

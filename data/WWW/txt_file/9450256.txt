using static analysis for ajax intrusion detection we present a static control-flow analysis for javascript programs running in a web browser . our analysis tackles numerous challenges posed by modern web applications including asynchronous communication , frameworks , and dynamic code generation . we use our analysis to extract a model of expected client behavior as seen from the server , and build an intrusion-prevention proxy for the server : the proxy intercepts client requests and disables those that do not meet the expected behavior . we insert random asynchronous requests to foil mimicry attacks . finally , we evaluate our technique against several real applications and show that it protects against an attack in a widely-used web application .

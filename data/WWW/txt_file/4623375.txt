netprobe : a fast and scalable system for fraud detection in online auction networks given a large online network of online auction users and their histories of transactions , how can we spot anomalies and auction fraud ? this paper describes the design and implementation of netprobe , a system that we propose for solving this problem . netprobe models auction users and transactions as a markov random field tuned to detect the suspicious patterns that fraudsters create , and employs a belief propagation mechanism to detect likely fraudsters . our experiments show that netprobe is both efficient and effective for fraud detection . we report experiments on synthetic graphs with as many as 7,000 nodes and 30,000 edges , where netprobe was able to spot fraudulent nodes with over 90 % precision and recall , within a matter of seconds . we also report experiments on a real dataset crawled from ebay , with nearly 700,000 transactions between more than 66,000 users , where netprobe was highly effective at unearthing hidden networks of fraudsters , within a realistic response time of about 6 minutes . for scenarios where the underlying data is dynamic in nature , we propose incrementalnetprobe , which is an approximate , but fast , variant of netprobe . our experiments prove that incremental netprobe executes nearly doubly fast as compared to netprobe , while retaining over 99 % of its accuracy .

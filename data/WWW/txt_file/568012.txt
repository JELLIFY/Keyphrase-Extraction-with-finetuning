xquery at your web service xml messaging is at the heart of web services , providing the flexibility required for their deployment , composition , and maintenance . yet , current approaches to web services development hide the messaging layer behind java or c # apis , preventing the application to get direct access to the underlying xml information . to address this problem , we advocate the use of a native xml language , namely xquery , as an integral part of the web services development infrastructure . the main contribution of the paper is a binding between wsdl , the web services description language , and xquery . the approach enables the use of xquery for both web services deployment and composition . we present a simple command-line tool that can be used to automatically deploy a web service from a given xquery module , and extend the xquery language itself with a statement for accessing one or more web services . the binding provides tight-coupling between wsdl and xquery , yielding additional benefits , notably : the ability to use wsdl as an interface language for xquery , and the ability to perform static typing on xquery programs that include web service calls . last but not least , the proposal requires only minimal changes to the existing infrastructure . we report on our experience implementing this approach in the galax xquery processor .

a flight meta-search engine with metamorph we demonstrate a flight meta-search engine that is based on the metamorph framework . metamorph provides mechanisms to model web forms together with the interactions which are needed to fulfil a request , and can generate interaction sequences that pose queries using these web forms and collect the results . in this paper , we discuss an interesting new feature that makes use of the forms themselves as an information source . we show how data can be extracted from web forms ( rather than the data behind web forms ) to generate a graph of flight connections between cities . the flight connection graph allows us to vastly reduce the number of queries that the engine sends to airline websites in the most interesting search scenarios ; those that involve the controversial practice of creative ticketing , in which agencies attempt to find lower price fares by using more than one airline for a journey . we describe a system which attains data from a number of websites to identify promising routes and prune the search tree . heuristics that make use of geographical information and an estimation of cost based on historical data are employed . the results are then made available to improve the quality of future search requests .

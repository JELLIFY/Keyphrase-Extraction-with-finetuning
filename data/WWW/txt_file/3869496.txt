an abuse-free fair contract signing protocol based on the rsa signature a fair contract signing protocol allows two potentially mistrusted parities to exchange their commitments ( i.e. , digital signatures ) to an agreed contract over the internet in a fair way , so that either each of them obtains the other 's signature , or neither party does . based on the rsa signature scheme , a new digital contract signing protocol is proposed in this paper . like the existing rsa-based solutions for the same problem , our protocol is not only fair , but also optimistic , since the third trusted party is involved only in the situations where one party is cheating or the communication channel is interrupted . furthermore , the proposed protocol satisfies a new property , i.e. , it is abuse-free . that is , if the protocol is executed unsuccessfully , none of the two parties can show the validity of intermediate results to others . technical details are provided to analyze the security and performance of the proposed protocol . in summary , we present the first abuse-free fair contract signing protocol based on the rsa signature , and show that it is both secure and efficient .

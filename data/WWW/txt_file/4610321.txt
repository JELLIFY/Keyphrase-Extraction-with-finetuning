one document to bind them : combining xml , web services , and the semantic web we present a paradigm for uniting the diverse strands of xml-based web technologies by allowing them to be incorporated within a single document . this overcomes the distinction between programs and data to make xml truly `` self-describing . '' a proposal for a lightweight yet powerful functional xml vocabulary called `` semantic fxml '' is detailed , based on the well-understood functional programming paradigm and resembling the embedding of lisp directly in xml . infosets are made `` dynamic , '' since documents can now directly embed local processes or web services into their infoset . an optional typing regime for info-sets is provided by semantic web ontologies . by regarding web services as functions and the semantic web as providing types , and tying it all together within a single xml vocabulary , the web can compute . in this light , the real web 2.0 can be considered the transformation of the web from a universal information space to a universal computation space .

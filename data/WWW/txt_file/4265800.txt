mining clickthrough data for collaborative web search this paper is to investigate the group behavior patterns of search activities based on web search history data , i.e. , clickthrough data , to boost search performance . we propose a collaborative web search ( cws ) framework based on the probabilistic modeling of the co-occurrence relationship among the heterogeneous web objects : users , queries , and web pages . the cws framework consists of two steps : ( 1 ) a cube-clustering approach is put forward to estimate the semantic cluster structures of the web objects ; ( 2 ) web search activities are conducted by leveraging the probabilistic relations among the estimated cluster structures . experiments on a real-world clickthrough data set validate the effectiveness of our cws approach .

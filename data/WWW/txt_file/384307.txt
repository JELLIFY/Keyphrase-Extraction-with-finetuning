practical semantic analysis of web sites and documents as web sites are now ordinary products , it is necessary to explicit the notion of quality of a web site . the quality of a site may belinked to the easiness of accessibility and also to other criteria such as the fact that the site is up to date and coherent . this last quality is difficult to insure because sites may be updated very frequently , may have many authors , may be partially generated and inthis context proof-reading is very difficult . the same piece of information may be found in different occurrences , but also in data ormeta-data , leading to the need for consistency checking . in this paper we make a parallel between programs and web sites . we present some examples of semantic constraints that one would like to specify ( constraints between the meaning of categories and sub-categories in a thematic directory , consistency between the organization chart and the rest of the site in an academic site ) . we present quickly the natural semantics a way to specify the semantics of programming languages that inspires ourworks . natural semantics itself comes from both an operational semantics and from logic programming and its implementation uses prolog . then we propose a specification language for semantic constraints in web sites that , in conjunction with the well known `` make '' program , permits to generate some site verification tools by compiling the specification into prolog code . we apply our method to alarge xml document which is the scientific part of our instituteactivity report , tracking errors or inconsistencies and alsoconstructing some indicators that can be used by the management of theinstitute .

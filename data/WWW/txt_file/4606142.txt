text-based video blogging a video blogging system has been developed for easily producing your own video programs that can be made available to the public in much the same way that blogs are created . the user merely types a program script on a webpage , the same as creating a blog , selects a direction style , and pastes in some additional material content to create a cg-based video program that can be openly distributed to the general public . the script , direction style , and material content are automatically combined to create a movie file on the server side . the movie file can then be accessed by referring to an rss feed and viewed on the screens of various devices .

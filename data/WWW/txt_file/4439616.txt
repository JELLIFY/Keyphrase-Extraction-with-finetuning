constructing extensible xquery mappings constructing and maintaining semantic mappings are necessary but troublesome in data sharing systems . while most current work focuses on seeking automated techniques to solve this problem , this paper proposes a combination model for constructing exten-sible mappings between xml schemas . in our model , complex global mappings are constructed by first defining simple atomic mappings for each target schema element , and then combining them using a few basic operators . at the same time , we provide automated support for constructing such combined mappings .

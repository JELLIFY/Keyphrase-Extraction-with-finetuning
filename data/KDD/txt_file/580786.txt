svm selective sampling for ranking with application to data retrieval learning ranking ( or preference ) functions has been a major issue in the machine learning community and has produced many applications in information retrieval . svms ( support vector machines ) - a classification and regression methodology - have also shown excellent performance in learning ranking functions . they effectively learn ranking functions of high generalization based on the `` large-margin '' principle and also systematically support nonlinear ranking by the `` kernel trick '' . in this paper , we propose an svm selective sampling technique for learning ranking functions . svm selective sampling ( or active learning with svm ) has been studied in the context of classification . such techniques reduce the labeling effort in learning classification functions by selecting only the most informative samples to be labeled . however , they are not extendable to learning ranking functions , as the labeled data in ranking is relative ordering , or partial orders of data . our proposed sampling technique effectively learns an accurate svm ranking function with fewer partial orders . we apply our sampling technique to the data retrieval application , which enables fuzzy search on relational databases by interacting with users for learning their preferences . experimental results show a significant reduction of the labeling effort in inducing accurate ranking functions .

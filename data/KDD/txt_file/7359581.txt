mining images on semantics via statistical learning in this paper , we have proposed a novel framework to enable hierarchical image classification via statistical learning . by integrating the concept hierarchy for semantic image concept organization , a hierarchical mixture model is proposed to enable multi-level modeling of semantic image concepts and hierarchical classifier combination . thus , learning the classifiers for the semantic image concepts at the high level of the concept hierarchy can be effectively achieved by detecting the presences of the relevant base-level atomic image concepts . to effectively learn the base-level classifiers for the atomic image concepts at the first level of the concept hierarchy , we have proposed a novel adaptive em algorithm to achieve more effective model selection and parameter estimation . in addition , a novel penalty term is proposed to effectively eliminate the misleading effects of the outlying unlabeled images on semi-supervised classifier training . our experimental results in a specific image domain of outdoor photos are very attractive .

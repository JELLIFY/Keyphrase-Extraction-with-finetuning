new objective functions for social collaborative filtering this paper examines the problem of social collaborative filtering ( cf ) to recommend items of interest to users in a social network setting . unlike standard cf algorithms using relatively simple user and item features , recommendation in social networks poses the more complex problem of learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of user profile and interaction information . many existing social cf methods have extended traditional cf matrix factorization , but have overlooked important aspects germane to the social setting . we propose a unified framework for social cf matrix factorization by introducing novel objective functions for training . our new objective functions have three key features that address main drawbacks of existing approaches : ( a ) we fully exploit feature-based user similarity , ( b ) we permit direct learning of user-to-user information diffusion , and ( c ) we leverage co-preference ( dis ) agreement between two users to learn restricted areas of common interest . we evaluate these new social cf objectives , comparing them to each other and to a variety of ( social ) cf baselines , and analyze user behavior on live user trials in a custom-developed facebook app involving data collected over five months from over 100 app users and their 37,000 + friends .

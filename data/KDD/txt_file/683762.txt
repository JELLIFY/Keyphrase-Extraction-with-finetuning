deriving marketing intelligence from online discussion weblogs and message boards provide online forums for discussion that record the voice of the public . woven into this mass of discussion is a wide range of opinion and commentary about consumer products . this presents an opportunity for companies to understand and respond to the consumer by analyzing this unsolicited feedback . given the volume , format and content of the data , the appropriate approach to understand this data is to use large-scale web and text data mining technologies . this paper argues that applications for mining large volumes of textual data for marketing intelligence should provide two key elements : a suite of powerful mining and visualization technologies and an interactive analysis environment which allows for rapid generation and testing of hypotheses . this paper presents such a system that gathers and annotates online discussion relating to consumer products using a wide variety of state-of-the-art techniques , including crawling , wrapping , search , text classification and computational linguistics . marketing intelligence is derived through an interactive analysis framework uniquely configured to leverage the connectivity and content of annotated online discussion .

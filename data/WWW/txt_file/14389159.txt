qube : a quick algorithm for updating betweenness centrality the betweenness centrality of a vertex in a graph is a measure for the participation of the vertex in the shortest paths in the graph . the betweenness centrality is widely used in network analyses . especially in a social network , the recursive computation of the betweenness centralities of vertices is performed for the community detection and finding the influential user in the network . since a social network graph is frequently updated , it is necessary to update the betweenness centrality efficiently . when a graph is changed , the betweenness centralities of all the vertices should be recomputed from scratch using all the vertices in the graph . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that proposes an efficient algorithm which handles the update of the betweenness centralities of vertices in a graph . in this paper , we propose a method that efficiently reduces the search space by finding a candidate set of vertices whose betweenness centralities can be updated and computes their betweenness centeralities using candidate vertices only . as the cost of calculating the betweenness centrality mainly depends on the number of vertices to be considered , the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the cost of calculation . the proposed algorithm allows the transformation of an existing algorithm which does not consider the graph update . experimental results on large real datasets show that the proposed algorithm speeds up the existing algorithm 2 to 2418 times depending on the dataset .

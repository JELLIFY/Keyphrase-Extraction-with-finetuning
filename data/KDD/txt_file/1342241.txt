querying multiple sets of discovered rules rule mining is an important data mining task that has been applied to numerous real-world applications . often a rule mining system generates a large number of rules and only a small subset of them is really useful in applications . although there exist some systems allowing the user to query the discovered rules , they are less suitable for complex ad hoc querying of multiple data mining rulebases to retrieve interesting rules . in this paper , we propose a new powerful rule query language rule-ql for querying multiple rulebases that is modeled after sql and has rigorous theoretical foundations of a rule-based calculus . in particular , we first propose a rule-based calculus rc based on the first-order logic , and then present the language rule-ql that is at least as expressive as the safe fragment of rc . we also propose a number of efficient query evaluation techniques for rule-ql and test them experimentally on some representative queries to demonstrate the feasibility of rule-ql .

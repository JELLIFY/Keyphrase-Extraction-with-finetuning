expertise modeling for matching papers with reviewers an essential part of an expert-finding task , such as matching reviewers to submitted papers , is the ability to model the expertise of a person based on documents . we evaluate several measures of the association between an author in an existing collection of research papers and a previously unseen document . we compare two language model based approaches with a novel topic model , author-persona-topic ( apt ) . in this model , each author can write under one or more `` personas , '' which are represented as independent distributions over hidden topics . examples of previous papers written by prospective reviewers are gathered from the rexa database , which extracts and disambiguates author mentions from documents gathered from the web . we evaluate the models using a reviewer matching task based on human relevance judgments determining how well the expertise of proposed reviewers matches a submission . we find that the apt topic model outperforms the other models .

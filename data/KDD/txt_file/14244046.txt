model order selection for boolean matrix factorization matrix factorizations -- where a given data matrix is approximated by a product of two or more factor matrices -- are powerful data mining tools . among other tasks , matrix factorizations are often used to separate global structure from noise . this , however , requires solving the ` model order selection problem ' of determining where fine-grained structure stops , and noise starts , i.e. , what is the proper size of the factor matrices . boolean matrix factorization ( bmf ) -- where data , factors , and matrix product are boolean -- has received increased attention from the data mining community in recent years . the technique has desirable properties , such as high interpretability and natural sparsity . but so far no method for selecting the correct model order for bmf has been available . in this paper we propose to use the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle for this task . besides solving the problem , this well-founded approach has numerous benefits , e.g. , it is automatic , does not require a likelihood function , is fast , and , as experiments show , is highly accurate . we formulate the description length function for bmf in general -- making it applicable for any bmf algorithm . we extend an existing algorithm for bmf to use mdl to identify the best boolean matrix factorization , analyze the complexity of the problem , and perform an extensive experimental evaluation to study its behavior .

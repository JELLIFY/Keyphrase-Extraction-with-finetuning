a scalable modular convex solver for regularized risk minimization a wide variety of machine learning problems can be described as minimizing a regularized risk functional , with different algorithms using different notions of risk and different regularizers . examples include linear support vector machines ( svms ) , logistic regression , conditional random fields ( crfs ) , and lasso amongst others . this paper describes the theory and implementation of a highly scalable and modular convex solver which solves all these estimation problems . it can be parallelized on a cluster of workstations , allows for data-locality , and can deal with regularizers such as l1 and l2 penalties . at present , our solver implements 20 different estimation problems , can be easily extended , scales to millions of observations , and is up to 10 times faster than specialized solvers for many applications . the open source code is freely available as part of the elefant toolbox .

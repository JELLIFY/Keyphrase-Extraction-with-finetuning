three theses of representation in the semantic web the semantic web is vitally dependent on a formal meaning for the constructs of its languages . for semantic web languages to work well together their formal meanings must employ a common view ( or thesis ) of representation , otherwise it will not be possible to reconcile documents written in different languages . the thesis of representation underlying rdf and rdfs is particularly troublesome in this regard , as it has several unusual aspects , both semantic and syntactic . a more-standard thesis of representation would result in the ability to reuse existing results and tools in the semantic web .

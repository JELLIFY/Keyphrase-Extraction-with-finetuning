a comparison of case-based reasoning approaches over the years software engineering researchers have suggested numerous techniques for estimating development effort . these techniques have been classified mainly as algorithmic , machine learning and expert judgement . several studies have compared the prediction accuracy of those techniques , with emphasis placed on linear regression , stepwise regression , and case-based reasoning ( cbr ) . to date no converging results have been obtained and we believe they may be influenced by the use of the same cbr configuration . the objective of this paper is twofold . first , to describe the application of case-based reasoning for estimating the effort for developing web hypermedia applications . second , comparing the prediction accuracy of different cbr configurations , using two web hypermedia datasets . results show that for both datasets the best estimations were obtained with weighted euclidean distance , using either one analogy ( dataset 1 ) or 3 analogies ( dataset 2 ) . we suggest therefore that case-based reasoning is a candidate technique for effort estimation and , with the aid of an automated environment , can be applied to web hypermedia development effort prediction .

empirical comparisons of various voting methods in bagging finding effective methods for developing an ensemble of models has been an active research area of large-scale data mining in recent years . models learned from data are often subject to some degree of uncertainty , for a variety of resoans . in classification , ensembles of models provide a useful means of averaging out error introduced by individual classifiers , hence reducing the generalization error of prediction . the plurality voting method is often chosen for bagging , because of its simplicity of implementation . however , the plurality approach to model reconciliation is ad-hoc . there are many other voting methods to choose from , including the anti-plurality method , the plurality method with elimination , the borda count method , and condorcet 's method of pairwise comparisons . any of these could lead to a better method for reconciliation . in this paper , we analyze the use of these voting methods in model reconciliation . we present empirical results comparing performance of these voting methods when applied in bagging . these results include some surprises , and among other things suggest that ( 1 ) plurality is not always the best voting method ; ( 2 ) the number of classes can affect the performance of voting methods ; and ( 3 ) the degree of dataset noise can affect the performance of voting methods . while it is premature to make final judgments about specific voting methods , the results of this work raise interesting questions , and they open the door to the application of voting theory in classification theory .

semantic similarity between search engine queries using temporal correlation we investigate the idea of finding semantically related search engine queries based on their temporal correlation ; in other words , we infer that two queries are related if their popularities behave similarly over time . to this end , we first define a new measure of the temporal correlation of two queries based on the correlation coefficient of their frequency functions . we then conduct extensive experiments using our measure on two massive query streams from the msn search engine , revealing that this technique can discover a wide range of semantically similar queries . finally , we develop a method of efficiently finding the highest correlated queries for a given input query using far less space and time than the naive approach , making real-time implementation possible .

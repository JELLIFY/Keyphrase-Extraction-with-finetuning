a convenient method for securely managing passwords computer users are asked to generate , keep secret , and recall an increasing number of passwords for uses including host accounts , email servers , e-commerce sites , and online financial services . unfortunately , the password entropy that users can comfortably memorize seems insufficient to store unique , secure passwords for all these accounts , and it is likely to remain constant as the number of passwords ( and the adversary 's computational power ) increases into the future . in this paper , we propose a technique that uses a strengthened cryptographic hash function to compute secure passwords for arbitrarily many accounts while requiring the user to memorize only a single short password . this mechanism functions entirely on the client ; no server-side changes are needed . unlike previous approaches , our design is both highly resistant to brute force attacks and nearly stateless , allowing users to retrieve their passwords from any location so long as they can execute our program and remember a short secret . this combination of security and convenience will , we believe , entice users to adopt our scheme . we discuss the construction of our algorithm in detail , compare its strengths and weaknesses to those of related approaches , and present password multiplier , an implementation in the form of an extension to the mozilla firefox web browser .

targeted disambiguation of ad-hoc , homogeneous sets of named entities in many entity extraction applications , the entities to be recognized are constrained to be from a list of `` target entities '' . in many cases , these target entities are ( i ) ad-hoc , i.e. , do not exist in a knowledge base and ( ii ) homogeneous ( e.g. , all the entities are it companies ) . we study the following novel disambiguation problem in this unique setting : given the candidate mentions of all the target entities , determine which ones are true mentions of a target entity . prior techniques only consider target entities present in a knowledge base and\/or having a rich set of attributes . in this paper , we develop novel techniques that require no knowledge about the entities except their names . our main insight is to leverage the homogeneity constraint and disambiguate the candidate mentions collectively across all documents . we propose a graph-based model , called mentionrank , for that purpose . furthermore , if additional knowledge is available for some or all of the entities , our model can leverage it to further improve quality . our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work on targeted entity disambiguation for ad-hoc entities .

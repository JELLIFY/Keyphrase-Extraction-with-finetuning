extracting temporal signatures for comprehending systems biology models systems biology has made massive strides in recent years , with capabilities to model complex systems including cell division , stress response , energy metabolism , and signaling pathways . concomitant with their improved modeling capabilities , however , such biochemical network models have also become notoriously complex for humans to comprehend . we propose network comprehension as a key problem for the kdd community , where the goal is to create explainable representations of complex biological networks . we formulate this problem as one of extracting temporal signatures from multi-variate time series data , where the signatures are composed of ordinal comparisons between time series components . we show how such signatures can be inferred by formulating the data mining problem as one of feature selection in rank-order space . we propose five new feature selection strategies for rank-order space and assess their selective superiorities . experimental results on budding yeast cell cycle models demonstrate compelling results comparable to human interpretations of the cell cycle .

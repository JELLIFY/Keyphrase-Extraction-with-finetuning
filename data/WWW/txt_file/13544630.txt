reliability analysis using weighted combinational models for web-based software in the past , some researches suggested that engineers can use combined software reliability growth models ( srgms ) to obtain more accurate reliability prediction during testing . in this paper , three weighted combinational models , namely , equal , linear , and nonlinear weight , are proposed for reliability estimation of web-based software . we further investigate the estimation accuracy of using genetic algorithm to determine the weight assignment for the proposed models . preliminary result shows that the linearly and nonlinearly weighted combinational models have better prediction capability than single srgm and equally weighted combinational model for web-based software .

extracting collective probabilistic forecasts from web games game sites on the world wide web draw people from around the world with specialized interests , skills , and knowledge . data from the games often reflects the players ' expertise and will to win . we extract probabilistic forecasts from data obtained from three online games : the hollywood stock exchange ( hsx ) , the foresight exchange ( fx ) , and the formula one pick six ( f1p6 ) competition . we find that all three yield accurate forecasts of uncertain future events . in particular , prices of so-called `` movie stocks '' on hsx are good indicators of actual box office returns . prices of hsx securities in oscar , emmy , and grammy awards correlate well with observed frequencies of winning . fx prices are reliable indicators of future developments in science and technology . collective predictions from players in the f1 competition serve as good forecasts of true race outcomes . in some cases , forecasts induced from game data are more reliable than expert opinions . we argue that web games naturally attract well-informed and well-motivated players , and thus offer a valuable and oft-overlooked source of high-quality data with significant predictive value .

open user profiles for adaptive news systems : help or harm ? over the last five years , a range of projects have focused on progressively more elaborated techniques for adaptive news delivery . however , the adaptation process in these systems has become more complicated and thus less transparent to the users . in this paper , we concentrate on the application of open user models in adding transparency and controllability to adaptive news systems . we present a personalized news system , yournews , which allows users to view and edit their interest profiles , and report a user study on the system . our results confirm that users prefer transparency and control in their systems , and generate more trust to such systems . however , similar to previous studies , our study demonstrate that this ability to edit user profiles may also harm the system . s performance and has to be used with caution .

smartint : using mined attribute dependencies to integrate fragmented web databases many web databases can be seen as providing partial and overlapping information about entities in the world . to answer queries effectively , we need to integrate the information about the individual entities that are fragmented over multiple sources . at first blush this is just the inverse of traditional database normalization problem - rather than go from a universal relation to normalized tables , we want to reconstruct the universal relation given the tables ( sources ) . the standard way of reconstructing the entities will involve joining the tables . unfortunately , because of the autonomous and decentralized way in which the sources are populated , they often do not have primary key - foreign key relations . while tables do share attributes , direct joins over these shared attributes can result in reconstruction of many spurious entities thus seriously compromising precision . we present a unified approach that supports intelligent retrieval over fragmented web databases by mining and using inter-table dependencies . experiments with the prototype implementation , smartint , show that its retrieval strikes a good balance between precision and recall .

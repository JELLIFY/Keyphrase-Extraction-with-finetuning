navigating the intranet with high precision despite the success of web search engines , search over large enterprise intranets still suffers from poor result quality . earlier work ( 6 ) that compared intranets and the internet from the view point of keyword search has pointed to several reasons why the search problem is quite different in these two domains . in this paper , we address the problem of providing high quality answers to navigational queries in the intranet ( e.g. , queries intended to find product or personal home pages , service pages , etc. ) . our approach is based on offline identification of navigational pages , intelligent generation of term-variants to associate with each page , and the construction of separate indices exclusively devoted to answering navigational queries . using a testbed of 5.5 m pages from the ibm intranet , we present evaluation results that demonstrate that for navigational queries , our approach of using custom indices produces results of significantly higher precision than those produced by a general purpose search algorithm .

improving web performance by client characterization driven server adaptation we categorize the set of clients communicating with a server on the web based on information that can be determined by the server . the web server uses the information to direct tailored actions . users with poor connectivity may choose not to stay at a web site if it takes a long time to receive a page , even if the web server at the site is not the bottleneck . retaining such clients may be of interest to a web site . better connected clients can receive enhanced representations of web pages , such as with higher quality images . we explore a variety of considerations that could be used by a web server in characterizing a client . once a client is characterized as poor or rich , the server can deliver altered content , alter how content is delivered , alter policy and caching decisions , or decide when to redirect the client to a mirror site . we also use network-aware client clustering techniques to provide a coarser level of client categorization and use it to categorize subsequent clients from that cluster for which a client-specific categorization is not available . our results for client characterization and applicable server actions are derived from real , recent , and diverse set of web server logs . our experiments demonstrate that a relatively simple characterization policy can classify poor clients such that these clients subsequently make the majority of badly performing requests to a web server . this policy is also stable in terms of clients staying in the same class for a large portion of the analysis period . client clustering can significantly help in initially classifying clients for which no previous information about the client is known . we also show that different server actions can be applied to a significant number of request sequences with poor performance .

adheat : an influence-based diffusion model for propagating hints to match ads in this paper , we present adheat , a social ad model considering user influence in addition to relevance for matching ads . traditionally , ad placement employs the relevance model . such a model matches ads with web page content , user interests , or both . we have observed , however , on social networks that the relevance model suffers from two shortcomings . first , influential users ( users who contribute opinions ) seldom click ads that are highly relevant to their expertise . second , because influential users ' contents and activities are attractive to other users , hint words summarizing their expertise and activities may be widely preferred . therefore , we propose adheat , which diffuses hint words of influential users to others and then matches ads for each user with aggregated hints . we performed experiments on a large online q&a community with half a million users . the experimental results show that adheat outperforms the relevance model on ctr ( click through rate ) by significant margins .

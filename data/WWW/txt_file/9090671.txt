querying for meta knowledge the semantic web is based on accessing and reusing rdf data from many different sources , which one may assign different levels of authority and credibility . existing semantic web query languages , like sparql , have targeted the retrieval , combination and reuse of facts , but have so far ignored all aspects of meta knowledge , such as origins , authorship , recency or certainty of data , to name but a few . in this paper , we present an original , generic , formalized and implemented approach for managing many dimensions of meta knowledge , like source , authorship , certainty and others . the approach re-uses existing rdf modeling possibilities in order to represent meta knowledge . then , it extends sparql query processing in such a way that given a sparql query for data , one may request meta knowledge without modifying the original query . thus , our approach achieves highly flexible and automatically coordinated querying for data and meta knowledge , while completely separating the two areas of concern .

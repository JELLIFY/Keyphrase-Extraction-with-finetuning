when do data mining results violate privacy ? privacy-preserving data mining has concentrated on obtaining valid results when the input data is private . an extreme example is secure multiparty computation-based methods , where only the results are revealed . however , this still leaves a potential privacy breach : do the results themselves violate privacy ? this paper explores this issue , developing a framework under which this question can be addressed . metrics are proposed , along with analysis that those metrics are consistent in the face of apparent problems .

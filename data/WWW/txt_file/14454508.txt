zencrowd : leveraging probabilistic reasoning and crowdsourcing techniques for large-scale entity linking we tackle the problem of entity linking for large collections of online pages ; our system , zencrowd , identifies entities from natural language text using state of the art techniques and automatically connects them to the linked open data cloud . we show how one can take advantage of human intelligence to improve the quality of the links by dynamically generating micro-tasks on an online crowdsourcing platform . we develop a probabilistic framework to make sensible decisions about candidate links and to identify unreliable human workers . we evaluate zencrowd in a real deployment and show how a combination of both probabilistic reasoning and crowdsourcing techniques can significantly improve the quality of the links , while limiting the amount of work performed by the crowd .

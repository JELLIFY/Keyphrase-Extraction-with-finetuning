design , implementation , and evaluation of a client characterization driven web server in earlier work we proposed a way for a web server to detect connectivity information about clients accessing it in order to take tailored actions for a client request . this paper describes the design , implementation , and evaluation of such a working system . a web site has a strong incentive to reduce the ` time-to-glass ' to retain users who may otherwise lose interest and leave the site . we have performed a measurement study from multiple client sites around the world with various levels of connectivity to the internet communicating with modified apache web servers under our control . the results show that clients can be classified in a correct and stable manner and that user-perceived latency can be reduced via tailored actions . our measurements show that classification and determination of server actions are done without significant overhead on the web server . we explore a variety of modified actions ranging from selecting a lower quality version of the resource to altering the manner of content delivery . by studying numerous performance related factors in a single unified framework and examining both individual actions as well as combination of actions , our modified web server implementation shows the efficacy of various server actions .

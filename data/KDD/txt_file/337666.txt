natural communities in large linked networks we are interested in finding natural communities in large-scale linked networks . our ultimate goal is to track changes over time in such communities . for such temporal tracking , we require a clustering algorithm that is relatively stable under small perturbations of the input data . we have developed an efficient , scalable agglomerative strategy and applied it to the citation graph of the nec citeseer database ( 250,000 papers ; 4.5 million citations ) . agglomerative clustering techniques are known to be unstable on data in which the community structure is not strong . we find that some communities are essentially random and thus unstable while others are natural and will appear in most clusterings . these natural communities will enable us to track the evolution of communities over time .

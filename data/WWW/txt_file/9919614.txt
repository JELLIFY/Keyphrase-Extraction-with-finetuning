what is twitter , a social network or a news media ? twitter , a microblogging service less than three years old , commands more than 41 million users as of july 2009 and is growing fast . twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets . the goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing . we have crawled the entire twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles , 1.47 billion social relations , 4,262 trending topics , and 106 million tweets . in its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution , a short effective diameter , and low reciprocity , which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks ( 28 ) . in order to identify influentials on twitter , we have ranked users by the number of followers and by pagerank and found two rankings to be similar . ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings , indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one 's tweets . we have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation . we have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority ( over 85 % ) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature . a closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet . once retweeted , a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops , signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet . to the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire twittersphere and information diffusion on it .

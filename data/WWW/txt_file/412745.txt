probabilistic query expansion using query logs query expansion has long been suggested as an effective way to resolve the short query and word mismatching problems . a number of query expansion methods have been proposed in traditional information retrieval . however , these previous methods do not take into account the specific characteristics of web searching ; in particular , of the availability of large amount of user interaction information recorded in the web query logs . in this study , we propose a new method for query expansion based on query logs . the central idea is to extract probabilistic correlations between query terms and document terms by analyzing query logs . these correlations are then used to select high-quality expansion terms for new queries . the experimental results show that our log-based probabilistic query expansion method can greatly improve the search performance and has several advantages over other existing methods .

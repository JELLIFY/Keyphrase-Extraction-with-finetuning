partitioned multi-indexing : bringing order to social search to answer search queries on a social network rich with user-generated content , it is desirable to give a higher ranking to content that is closer to the individual issuing the query . queries occur at nodes in the network , documents are also created by nodes in the same network , and the goal is to find the document that matches the query and is closest in network distance to the node issuing the query . in this paper , we present the `` partitioned multi-indexing '' scheme , which provides an approximate solution to this problem . with m links in the network , after an offline ~ o ( m ) pre-processing time , our scheme allows for social index operations ( i.e. , social search queries , as well as insertion and deletion of words into and from a document at any node ) , all in time ~ o ( 1 ) . further , our scheme can be implemented on open source distributed streaming systems such as yahoo ! s4 or twitter 's storm so that every social index operation takes ~ o ( 1 ) processing time and network queries in the worst case , and just two network queries in the common case where the reverse index corresponding to the query keyword is much smaller than the memory available at any distributed compute node . building on das sarma et al. 's approximate distance oracle , the worst-case approximation ratio of our scheme is ~ o ( 1 ) for undirected networks . our simulations on the social network twitter as well as synthetic networks show that in practice , the approximation ratio is actually close to 1 for both directed and undirected networks . we believe that this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of social search with real-time text updates at large scales .

ranking a stream of news according to a recent survey made by nielsen netratings , searching on news articles is one of the most important activity online . indeed , google , yahoo , msn and many others have proposed commercial search engines for indexing news feeds . despite this commercial interest , no academic research has focused on ranking a stream of news articles and a set of news sources . in this paper , we introduce this problem by proposing a ranking framework which models : ( 1 ) the process of generation of a stream of news articles , ( 2 ) the news articles clustering by topics , and ( 3 ) the evolution of news story over the time . the ranking algorithm proposed ranks news information , finding the most authoritative news sources and identifying the most interesting events in the different categories to which news article belongs . all these ranking measures take in account the time and can be obtained without a predefined sliding window of observation over the stream . the complexity of our algorithm is linear in the number of pieces of news still under consideration at the time of a new posting . this allow a continuous on-line process of ranking . our ranking framework is validated on a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of news , produced in two months by more then 2000 news sources belonging to 13 different categories ( world , u. s , europe , sports , business , etc ) . this collection is extracted from the index of cometomyhead , an academic news search engine available online .

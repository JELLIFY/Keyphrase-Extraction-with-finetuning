race : finding and ranking compact connected trees for keyword proximity search over xml documents in this paper , we study the problem of keyword proximity search over xml documents and leverage the efficiency and effectiveness . we take the disjunctive semantics among input keywords into consideration and identify meaningful compact connected trees as the answers of keyword proximity queries . we introduce the notions of compact lowest common ancestor ( clca ) and maximal clca ( mclca ) and propose compact connected trees ( cctrees ) and maximal cctrees ( mcctrees ) to efficiently and effectively answer keyword queries . we propose a novel ranking mechanism , race , to rank compact connected trees , by taking into consideration both the structural similarity and the textual similarity . our extensive experimental study shows that our method achieves both high search efficiency and effectiveness , and outperforms existing approaches significantly .

on measuring the quality of wikipedia articles this paper discusses an approach to modeling and measuring information quality of wikipedia articles . the approach is based on the idea that the quality of wikipedia articles with distinctly different profiles needs to be measured using different information quality models . we report on our initial study , which involved two categories of wikipedia articles : `` stabilized '' ( those , whose content has not undergone major changes for a significant period of time ) and `` controversial '' ( the articles , which have undergone vandalism , revert wars , or whose content is subject to internal discussions between wikipedia editors ) . we present simple information quality models and compare their performance on a subset of wikipedia articles with the information quality evaluations provided by human users . our experiment shows , that using special-purpose models for information quality captures user sentiment about wikipedia articles better than using a single model for both categories of articles .

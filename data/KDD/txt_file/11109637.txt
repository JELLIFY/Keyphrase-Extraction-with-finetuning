an efficient algorithm for a class of fused lasso problems the fused lasso penalty enforces sparsity in both the coefficients and their successive differences , which is desirable for applications with features ordered in some meaningful way . the resulting problem is , however , challenging to solve , as the fused lasso penalty is both non-smooth and non-separable . existing algorithms have high computational complexity and do not scale to large-size problems . in this paper , we propose an efficient fused lasso algorithm ( efla ) for optimizing this class of problems . one key building block in the proposed efla is the fused lasso signal approximator ( flsa ) . to efficiently solve flsa , we propose to reformulate it as the problem of finding an `` appropriate '' subgradient of the fused penalty at the minimizer , and develop a subgradient finding algorithm ( sfa ) . we further design a restart technique to accelerate the convergence of sfa , by exploiting the special `` structures '' of both the original and the reformulated flsa problems . our empirical evaluations show that , both sfa and efla significantly outperform existing solvers . we also demonstrate several applications of the fused lasso .

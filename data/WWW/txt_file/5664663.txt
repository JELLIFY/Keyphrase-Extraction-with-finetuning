spatial variation in search engine queries local aspects of web search - associating web content and queries with geography - is a topic of growing interest . however , the underlying question of how spatial variation is manifested in search queries is still not well understood . here we develop a probabilistic framework for quantifying such spatial variation ; on complete yahoo ! query logs , we find that our model is able to localize large classes of queries to within a few miles of their natural centers based only on the distribution of activity for the query . our model provides not only an estimate of a query 's geographic center , but also a measure of its spatial dispersion , indicating whether it has highly local interest or broader regional or national appeal . we also show how variations on our model can track geographically shifting topics over time , annotate a map with each location 's `` distinctive queries '' , and delineate the `` spheres of influence '' for competing queries in the same general domain .

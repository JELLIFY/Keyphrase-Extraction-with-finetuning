unified analysis of streaming news news clustering , categorization and analysis are key components of any news portal . they require algorithms capable of dealing with dynamic data to cluster , interpret and to temporally aggregate news articles . these three tasks are often solved separately . in this paper we present a unified framework to group incoming news articles into temporary but tightly-focused storylines , to identify prevalent topics and key entities within these stories , and to reveal the temporal structure of stories as they evolve . we achieve this by building a hybrid clustering and topic model . to deal with the available wealth of data we build an efficient parallel inference algorithm by sequential monte carlo estimation . time and memory costs are nearly constant in the length of the history , and the approach scales to hundreds of thousands of documents . we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy on the publicly available tdt dataset and data of a major internet news site .

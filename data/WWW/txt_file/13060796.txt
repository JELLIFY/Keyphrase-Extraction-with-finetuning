sentence-level contextual opinion retrieval existing opinion retrieval techniques do not provide context-dependent relevant results . most of the approaches used by state-of-the-art techniques are based on frequency of query terms , such that all documents containing query terms are retrieved , regardless of contextual relevance to the intent of the human seeking the opinion . however , in a particular opinionated document , words could occur in different contexts , yet meet the frequency attached to a certain opinion threshold , thus explicitly creating a bias in overall opinion retrieved . in this paper we propose a sentence-level contextual model for opinion retrieval using grammatical tree derivations and approval voting mechanism . model evaluation performed between our contextual model , bm25 , and language model shows that the model can be effective for contextual opinion retrieval such as faceted opinion retrieval .

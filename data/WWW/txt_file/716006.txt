predictive caching and prefetching of query results in search engines we study the caching of query result pages in web search engines . popular search engines receive millions of queries per day , and efficient policies for caching query results may enable them to lower their response time and reduce their hardware requirements . we present pdc ( probability driven cache ) , a novel scheme tailored for caching search results , that is based on a probabilistic model of search engine users . we then use a trace of over seven million queries submitted to the search engine altavista to evaluate pdc , as well as traditional lru and slru based caching schemes . the trace driven simulations show that pdc outperforms the other policies . we also examine the prefetching of search results , and demonstrate that prefetching can increase cache hit ratios by 50 % for large caches , and can double the hit ratios of small caches . when integrating prefetching into pdc , we attain hit ratios of over 0.53 .

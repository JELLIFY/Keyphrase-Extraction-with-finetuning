on the lack of typical behavior in the global web traffic network we offer the first large-scale analysis of web traffic based on network flow data . using data collected on the internet2 network , we constructed a weighted bipartite client-server host graph containing more than 18 x 106 vertices and 68 x 106 edges valued by relative traffic flows . when considered as a traffic map of the world-wide web , the generated graph provides valuable information on the statistical patterns that characterize the global information flow on the web . statistical analysis shows that client-server connections and traffic flows exhibit heavy-tailed probability distributions lacking any typical scale . in particular , the absence of an intrinsic average in some of the distributions implies the absence of a prototypical scale appropriate for server design , web-centric network design , or traffic modeling . the inspection of the amount of traffic handled by clients and servers and their number of connections highlights non-trivial correlations between information flow and patterns of connectivity as well as the presence of anomalous statistical patterns related to the behavior of users on the web . the results presented here may impact considerably the modeling , scalability analysis , and behavioral study of web applications .

gossip based streaming in this paper , we propose a novel multicast streaming protocol foroverlay networks , called gossip based streaming ( gbs ) . in gbs , streaming contents are not come from a single upstream source , but delivered from several sources to a client . though being similarto existing gossip protocols , the unique requirements forstreaming , such as continuous playback , are addressed in our design . preliminary results show that gbs performs much better indynamic user environments .

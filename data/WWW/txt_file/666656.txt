the web around the corner : augmenting the browser with gps as programmable mobile devices ( such as high-end cellular phones and personal digital assistants ) became widely adopted , users ask for internet access on-the-road . while upcoming technologies like umts and wi-fi provide broadband wireless communication , web services and web browsers do not provide any sort of location-awareness yet . as gps receivers get cheaper , positioning devices will be embedded into commercial mobile devices . thus , the position of the user can be used to filter and tailor the information presented to the user as already done for language preferences and user-agent . this paper describes early results of an ongoing project called gpsweb , which aims to provide gps support for web browsers and an application model for location-based services . it introduces the location-based browsing concept that enhances the classic webuser-website interaction .

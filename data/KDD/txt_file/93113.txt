fast vertical mining using diffsets a number of vertical mining algorithms have been proposed recently for association mining , which have shown to be very effective and usually outperform horizontal approaches . the main advantage of the vertical format is support for fast frequency counting via intersection operations on transaction ids ( tids ) and automatic pruning of irrelevant data . the main problem with these approaches is when intermediate results of vertical tid lists become too large for memory , thus affecting the algorithm scalability . in this paper we present a novel vertical data representation called diffset , that only keeps track of differences in the tids of a candidate pattern from its generating frequent patterns . we show that diffsets drastically cut down the size of memory required to store intermediate results . we show how diffsets , when incorporated into previous vertical mining methods , increase the performance significantly .

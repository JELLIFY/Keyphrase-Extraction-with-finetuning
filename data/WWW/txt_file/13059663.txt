entitytagger : automatically tagging entities with descriptive phrases we consider the problem of entity tagging : given one or more named entities from a specific domain , the goal is to automatically associate descriptive phrases , referred to as etags ( entity tags ) , to each entity . consider a product catalog containing product names and possibly short descriptions . for a product in the catalog , say ricoh g600 digital camera , we want to associate etags such as `` water resistant '' , `` rugged '' and `` outdoor '' to it , even though its name or description does not mention those phrases . entity tagging can enable more effective search over entities . we propose to leverage signals in web documents to perform such tagging . we develop techniques to perform such tagging in a domain independent manner while ensuring high precision and high recall .

learning optimal ranking with tensor factorization for tag recommendation tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item . this is important for many websites with tagging capabilities like last . fm or delicious . in this paper , we propose a method for tag recommendation based on tensor factorization ( tf ) . in contrast to other tf methods like higher order singular value decomposition ( hosvd ) , our method rtf ( ` ranking with tensor factorization ' ) directly optimizes the factorization model for the best personalized ranking . rtf handles missing values and learns from pairwise ranking constraints . our optimization criterion for tf is motivated by a detailed analysis of the problem and of interpretation schemes for the observed data in tagging systems . in all , rtf directly optimizes for the actual problem using a correct interpretation of the data . we provide a gradient descent algorithm to solve our optimization problem . we also provide an improved learning and prediction method with runtime complexity analysis for rtf . the prediction runtime of rtf is independent of the number of observations and only depends on the factorization dimensions . besides the theoretical analysis , we empirically show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art tag recommendation methods like folkrank , pagerank and hosvd both in quality and prediction runtime .

similarity spreading : a unified framework for similarity calculation of interrelated objects in many web search applications , similarities between objects of one type ( say , queries ) can be affected by the similarities between their interrelated objects of another type ( say , web pages ) , and vice versa . we propose a novel framework called similarity spreading to take account of the interrelationship and improve the similarity calculation . experiment results show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the accuracy of the similarity measurement of the objects in a search engine .

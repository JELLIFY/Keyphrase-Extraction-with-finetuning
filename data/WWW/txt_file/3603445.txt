an experimental study on large-scale web categorization taxonomies of the web typically have hundreds of thousands of categories and skewed category distribution over documents . it is not clear whether existing text classification technologies can perform well on and scale up to such large-scale applications . to understand this , we conducted the evaluation of several representative methods ( support vector machines , k-nearest neighbor and naive bayes ) with yahoo ! taxonomies . in particular , we evaluated the effectiveness\/efficiency tradeoff in classifiers with hierarchical setting compared to conventional ( flat ) setting , and tested popular threshold tuning strategies for their scalability and accuracy in large-scale classification problems .

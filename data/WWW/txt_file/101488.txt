the interoperability of learning object repositories and services : standards , implementations and lessons learned interoperability is one of the main issues in creating a networked system of repositories . the edusource project in its holisticapproach to building a network of learning object repositories in canada is implementing an open network for learning services . itsopenness is supported by a communication protocol called theedusource communications layer ( ecl ) which closely implements the ims digital repository interoperability ( dri ) specification and architecture . the ecl in conjunction withconnection middleware enables any service providers to join thenetwork . edusource is open to external initiatives as it explicitlysupports an extensible bridging mechanism between edusource and other major initiatives . this paper discusses interoperability in general and then focuses on the design of ecl as animplementation of ims dri with supporting infrastructure andmiddleware . the edusource implementation is in the mature stateof its development as being deployed in different settings withdifferent partners . two applications used in evaluating ourapproach are described : a gateway for connecting betweenedusource and the nsdl initiative , and a federated searchconnecting edusource , edna and smete .

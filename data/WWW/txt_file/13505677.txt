irin : image retrieval in image-rich information networks in this demo , we present a system called irin designed for performing image retrieval in image-rich information networks . we first introduce mok-simrank to significantly improve the speed of simrank , one of the most popular algorithms for computing node similarity in information networks . next , we propose an algorithm called simlearn to ( 1 ) extend mok-simrank to heterogeneous image-rich information network , and ( 2 ) account for both link-based and content-based similarities by seamlessly integrating reinforcement learning with feature learning .

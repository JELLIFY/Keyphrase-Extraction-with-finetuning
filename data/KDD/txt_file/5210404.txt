wavelet synopsis for data streams : minimizing non-euclidean error we consider the wavelet synopsis construction problem for data streams where given n numbers we wish to estimate the data by constructing a synopsis , whose size , say b is much smaller than n. the b numbers are chosen to minimize a suitable error between the original data and the estimate derived from the synopsis . several good one-pass wavelet construction streaming algorithms minimizing the l2 error exist . for other error measures , the problem is less understood . we provide the first one-pass small space streaming algorithms with provable error guarantees ( additive approximation ) for minimizing a variety of non-euclidean error measures including all weighted lp ( including l ∞ ) and relative error lp metrics . in several previous works solutions ( for weighted l2 , l ∞ and maximum relative error ) where the b synopsis coefficients are restricted to be wavelet coefficients of the data were proposed . this restriction yields suboptimal solutions on even fairly simple examples . other lines of research , such as probabilistic synopsis , imposed restrictions on how the synopsis was arrived at . to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first paper to address the general problem , without any restriction on how the synopsis is arrived at , as well as provide the first streaming algorithms with guaranteed performance for these classes of error measures .

analyzing patterns of user content generation in online social networks various online social networks ( osns ) have been developed rapidly on the internet . researchers have analyzed different properties of such osns , mainly focusing on the formation and evolution of the networks as well as the information propagation over the networks . in knowledge-sharing osns , such as blogs and question answering systems , issues on how users participate in the network and how users `` generate\/contribute '' knowledge are vital to the sustained and healthy growth of the networks . however , related discussions have not been reported in the research literature . in this work , we empirically study workloads from three popular knowledge-sharing osns , including a blog system , a social bookmark sharing network , and a question answering social network to examine these properties . our analysis consistently shows that ( 1 ) users ' posting behavior in these networks exhibits strong daily and weekly patterns , but the user active time in these osns does not follow exponential distributions ; ( 2 ) the user posting behavior in these osns follows stretched exponential distributions instead of power-law distributions , indicating the influence of a small number of core users can not dominate the network ; ( 3 ) the distributions of user contributions on high-quality and effort-consuming contents in these osns have smaller stretch factors for the stretched exponential distribution . our study provides insights into user activity patterns and lays out an analytical foundation for further understanding various properties of these osns .

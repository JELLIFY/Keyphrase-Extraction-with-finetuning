a flexible generative model for preference aggregation many areas of study , such as information retrieval , collaborative filtering , and social choice face the preference aggregation problem , in which multiple preferences over objects must be combined into a consensus ranking . preferences over items can be expressed in a variety of forms , which makes the aggregation problem difficult . in this work we formulate a flexible probabilistic model over pairwise comparisons that can accommodate all these forms . inference in the model is very fast , making it applicable to problems with hundreds of thousands of preferences . experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance to existing methods

semantic navigation on the web of data : specification of routes , web fragments and actions the massive semantic data sources linked in the web of data give new meaning to old features like navigation ; introduce new challenges like semantic specification of web fragments ; and make it possible to specify actions relying on semantic data . in this paper we introduce a declarative language to face these challenges . based on navigational features , it is designed to specify fragments of the web of data and actions to be performed based on these data . we implement it in a centralized fashion , and show its power and performance . finally , we explore the same ideas in a distributed setting , showing their feasibility , potentialities and challenges .

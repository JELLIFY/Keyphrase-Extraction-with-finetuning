learning deterministic regular expressions for the inference of schemas from xml data inferring an appropriate dtd or xml schema definition ( xsd ) for a given collection of xml documents essentially reduces to learning deterministic regular expressions from sets of positive example words . unfortunately , there is no algorithm capable of learning the complete class of deterministic regular expressions from positive examples only , as we will show . the regular expressions occurring in practical dtds and xsds , however , are such that every alphabet symbol occurs only a small number of times . as such , in practice it suffices to learn the subclass of regular expressions in which each alphabet symbol occurs at most k times , for some small k. we refer to such expressions as k-occurrence regular expressions ( k-ores for short ) . motivated by this observation , we provide a probabilistic algorithm that learns k-ores for increasing values of k , and selects the one that best describes the sample based on a minimum description length argument . the effectiveness of the method is empirically validated both on real world and synthetic data . furthermore , the method is shown to be conservative over the simpler classes of expressions considered in previous work .

partial example acquisition in cost-sensitive learning it is often expensive to acquire data in real-world data mining applications . most previous data mining and machine learning research , however , assumes that a fixed set of training examples is given . in this paper , we propose an online cost-sensitive framework that allows a learner to dynamically acquire examples as it learns , and to decide the ideal number of examples needed to minimize the total cost . we also propose a new strategy for partial example acquisition ( pas ) , in which the learner can acquire examples with a subset of attribute values to reduce the data acquisition cost . experiments on uci datasets show that the new pas strategy is an effective method in reducing the total cost for data acquisition .

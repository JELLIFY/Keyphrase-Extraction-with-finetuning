on the informativeness of cascade and intent-aware effectiveness measures the maximum entropy method provides one technique for validating search engine effectiveness measures . under this method , the value of an effectiveness measure is used as a constraint to estimate the most likely distribution of relevant documents under a maximum entropy assumption . this inferred distribution may then be compared to the actual distribution to quantify the `` informativeness '' of the measure . the inferred distribution may also be used to estimate values for other effectiveness measures . previous work focused on traditional effectiveness measures , such as average precision . in this paper , we extend the maximum entropy method to the newer cascade and intent-aware effectiveness measures by considering the dependency of the documents ranked in a results list . these measures are intended to reflect the novelty and diversity of search results in addition to the traditional relevance . our results indicate that intent-aware measures based on the cascade model are informative in terms of both inferring actual distribution and predicting the values of other retrieval measures .

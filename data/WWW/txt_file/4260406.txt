online curriculum on the semantic web : the csd-uoc portal for peer-to-peer e-learning online curriculum portals aim to support networks of instructors and learners by providing a space of convergence for enhancing peer-to-peer learning interactions among individuals of an educational institution . to this end , effective , open and scalable e-learning systems are required to acquire , store , and share knowledge under the form of learning objects ( lo ) . in this paper , we are interested in exploiting the semantic relationships that characterize these los ( e.g. , prerequisite , part-of or see-also ) in order to capture and access individual and group knowledge in conjunction with the learning processes supported by educational institutions . to achieve this functionality , semantic web ( e.g. , rdf\/s ) and declarative query languages ( e.g. , rql ) are employed to represent los and their relationships ( e.g. , lom ) , as well as , to support navigation at the conceptual e-learning portal space . in this way , different los could be presented to the same learners , according to the traversed schema navigation paths ( i.e. , learning paths ) . using the apache jetspeed framework we are able to generate and assemble at run-time portlets ( i.e. , pluggable web components ) for visualizing personalized views as dynamic web pages . last but not least , both learners and instructors can employ the same portal gui for updating semantically described los and thus support an open-ended continuum of learning . to the best of our knowledge , the work presented in this paper is the first online curriculum portal platform supporting the aforementioned functionality .

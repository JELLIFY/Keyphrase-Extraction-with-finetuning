co-clustering based classification for out-of-domain documents in many real world applications , labeled data are in short supply . it often happens that obtaining labeled data in a new domain is expensive and time consuming , while there may be plenty of labeled data from a related but different domain . traditional machine learning is not able to cope well with learning across different domains . in this paper , we address this problem for a text-mining task , where the labeled data are under one distribution in one domain known as in-domain data , while the unlabeled data are under a related but different domain known as out-of-domain data . our general goal is to learn from the in-domain and apply the learned knowledge to out-of-domain . we propose a co-clustering based classification ( cocc ) algorithm to tackle this problem . co-clustering is used as a bridge to propagate the class structure and knowledge from the in-domain to the out-of-domain . we present theoretical and empirical analysis to show that our algorithm is able to produce high quality classification results , even when the distributions between the two data are different . the experimental results show that our algorithm greatly improves the classification performance over the traditional learning algorithms .

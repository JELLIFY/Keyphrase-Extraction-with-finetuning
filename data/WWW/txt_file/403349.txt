using urls and table layout for web classification tasks we propose new features and algorithms for automating web-page classification tasks such as content recommendation and ad blocking . we show that the automated classification of web pages can be much improved if , instead of looking at their textual content , we consider each links 's url and the visual placement of those links on a referring page . these features are unusual : rather than being scalar measurements like word counts they are tree structured -- describing the position of the item in a tree . we develop a model and algorithm for machine learning using such tree-structured features . we apply our methods in automated tools for recognizing and blocking web advertisements and for recommending `` interesting '' news stories to a reader . experiments show that our algorithms are both faster and more accurate than those based on the text content of web documents .

can we learn a template-independent wrapper for news article extraction from a single training site ? automatic news extraction from news pages is important in many web applications such as news aggregation . however , the existing news extraction methods based on template-level wrapper induction have three serious limitations . first , the existing methods can not correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template . second , it is costly to maintain up-to-date wrappers for a large amount of news websites , because any change of a template may invalidate the corresponding wrapper . last , the existing methods can merely extract unformatted plain texts , and thus are not user friendly . in this paper , we tackle the problem of template-independent web news extraction in a user-friendly way . we formalize web news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site . novel features dedicated to news titles and bodies are developed . correlations between news titles and news bodies are exploited . our template-independent wrapper can extract news pages from different sites regardless of templates . moreover , our approach can extract not only texts , but also images and animates within the news bodies and the extracted news articles are in the same visual style as in the original pages . in our experiments , a wrapper learned from 40 pages from a single news site achieved an accuracy of 98.1 % on 3,973 news pages from 12 news sites .

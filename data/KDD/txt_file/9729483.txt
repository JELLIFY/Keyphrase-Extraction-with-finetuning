ranking-based clustering of heterogeneous information networks with star network schema a heterogeneous information network is an information network composed of multiple types of objects . clustering on such a network may lead to better understanding of both hidden structures of the network and the individual role played by every object in each cluster . however , although clustering on homogeneous networks has been studied over decades , clustering on heterogeneous networks has not been addressed until recently . a recent study proposed a new algorithm , rankclus , for clustering on bi-typed heterogeneous networks . however , a real-world network may consist of more than two types , and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics that a network carries . in this paper , we study clustering of multi-typed heterogeneous networks with a star network schema and propose a novel algorithm , netclus , that utilizes links across multityped objects to generate high-quality net-clusters . an iterative enhancement method is developed that leads to effective ranking-based clustering in such heterogeneous networks . our experiments on dblp data show that netclus generates more accurate clustering results than the baseline topic model algorithm plsa and the recently proposed algorithm , rankclus . further , netclus generates informative clusters , presenting good ranking and cluster membership information for each attribute object in each net-cluster .

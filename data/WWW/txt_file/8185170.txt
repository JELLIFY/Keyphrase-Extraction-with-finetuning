a clustering method for web data with multi-type interrelated components traditional clustering algorithms work on `` flat '' data , making the assumption that the data instances can only be represented by a set of homogeneous and uniform features . many real world data , however , is heterogeneous in nature , comprising of multiple types of interrelated components . we present a clustering algorithm , k-svmeans , that integrates the well known k-means clustering with the highly popular support vector machines ( svm ) in order to utilize the richness of data . our experimental results on authorship analysis of scientific publications show that k-svmeans achieves better clustering performance than homogeneous data clustering .

extracting decision trees from trained neural networks neural networks are successful in acquiring hidden knowledge in datasets . their biggest weakness is that the knowledge they acquire is represented in a form not understandable to humans . researchers tried to address this problem by extracting rules from trained neural networks . most of the proposed rule extraction methods required specialized type of neural networks ; some required binary inputs and some were computationally expensive . craven proposed extracting mofn type decision trees from neural networks . we believe mofn type decision trees are only good for mofn type problems and trees created for regular high dimensional real world problems may be very complex . in this paper , we introduced a new method for extracting regular c4 .5 like decision trees from trained neural networks . we showed that the new method ( dectext ) is effective in extracting high fidelity trees from trained networks . we also introduced a new discretization technique to make dectext be able to handle continuous features and a new pruning technique for finding simplest tree with the highest fidelity .

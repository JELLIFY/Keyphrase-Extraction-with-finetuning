the mathematics of causal inference i will review concepts , principles , and mathematical tools that were found useful in applications involving causal and counterfactual relationships . this semantical framework , enriched with a few ideas from logic and graph theory , gives rise to a complete , coherent , and friendly calculus of causation that unifies the graphical and counterfactual approaches to causation and resolves many long-standing problems in several of the sciences . these include questions of causal effect estimation , policy analysis , and the integration of data from diverse studies . of special interest to kdd researchers would be the following topics : the mediation formula , and what it tells us about direct and indirect effects . what mathematics can tell us about `` external validity '' or `` generalizing from experiments '' what can graph theory tell us about recovering from sample-selection bias .

interpretable nonnegative matrix decompositions a matrix decomposition expresses a matrix as a product of at least two factor matrices . equivalently , it expresses each column of the input matrix as a linear combination of the columns in the first factor matrix . the interpretability of the decompositions is a key issue in many data-analysis tasks . we propose two new matrix-decomposition problems : the nonnegative cx and nonnegative cur problems , that give naturally interpretable factors . they extend the recently-proposed column and column-row based decompositions , and are aimed to be used with nonnegative matrices . our decompositions represent the input matrix as a nonnegative linear combination of a subset of its columns ( or columns and rows ) . we present two algorithms to solve these problems and provide an extensive experimental evaluation where we assess the quality of our algorithms ' results as well as the intuitiveness of nonnegative cx and cur decompositions . we show that our algorithms return intuitive answers with smaller reconstruction errors than the previously-proposed methods for column and column-row decompositions .

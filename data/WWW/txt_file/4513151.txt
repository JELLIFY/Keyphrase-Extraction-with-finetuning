towards effective browsing of large scale social annotations this paper is concerned with the problem of browsing social annotations . today , a lot of services ( e.g. , del. icio . us , filckr ) have been provided for helping users to manage and share their favorite urls and photos based on social annotations . due to the exponential increasing of the social annotations , more and more users , however , are facing the problem how to effectively find desired resources from large annotation data . existing methods such as tag cloud and annotation matching work well only on small annotation sets . thus , an effective approach for browsing large scale annotation sets and the associated resources is in great demand by both ordinary users and service providers . in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm , namely effective large scale annotation browser ( elsaber ) , to browse large-scale social annotation data . elsaber helps the users browse huge number of annotations in a semantic , hierarchical and efficient way . more specifically , elsaber has the following features : 1 ) the semantic relations between annotations are explored for browsing of similar resources ; 2 ) the hierarchical relations between annotations are constructed for browsing in a top-down fashion ; 3 ) the distribution of social annotations is studied for efficient browsing . by incorporating the personal and time information , elsaber can be further extended for personalized and time-related browsing . a prototype system is implemented and shows promising results .

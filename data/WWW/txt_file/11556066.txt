fast and parallel webpage layout the web browser is a cpu-intensive program . especially on mobile devices , webpages load too slowly , expending significant time in processing a document 's appearance . due to power constraints , most hardware-driven speedups will come in the form of parallel architectures . this is also true of mobile devices such as phones and e-books . in this paper , we introduce new algorithms for css selector matching , layout solving , and font rendering , which represent key components for a fast layout engine . evaluation on popular sites shows speedups as high as 80x . we also formulate the layout problem with attribute grammars , enabling us to not only parallelize our algorithm but prove that it computes in o ( log ) time and without reflow .

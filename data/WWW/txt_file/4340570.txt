adaptive record extraction from web pages we describe an adaptive method for extracting records from web pages . our algorithm combines a weighted tree matching metric with clustering for obtaining data extraction patterns . we compare our method experimentally to the state-of-the-art , and show that our approach is very competitive for rigidly-structured records ( such as product descriptions ) and far superior for loosely-structured records ( such as entrieson blogs ) .

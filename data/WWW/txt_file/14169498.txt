document recommendation in social tagging services social tagging services allow users to annotate various online resources with freely chosen keywords ( tags ) . they not only facilitate the users in finding and organizing online resources , but also provide meaningful collaborative semantic data which can potentially be exploited by recommender systems . traditional studies on recommender systems focused on user rating data , while recently social tagging data is becoming more and more prevalent . how to perform resource recommendation based on tagging data is an emerging research topic . in this paper we consider the problem of document ( e.g. web pages , research papers ) recommendation using purely tagging data . that is , we only have data containing users , tags , documents and the relationships among them . we propose a novel graph-based representation learning algorithm for this purpose . the users , tags and documents are represented in the same semantic space in which two related objects are close to each other . for a given user , we recommend those documents that are sufficiently close to him\/her . experimental results on two data sets crawled from del. icio . us and citeulike show that our algorithm can generate promising recommendations and outperforms traditional recommendation algorithms .

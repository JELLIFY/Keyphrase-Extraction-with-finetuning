divrank : the interplay of prestige and diversity in information networks information networks are widely used to characterize the relationships between data items such as text documents . many important retrieval and mining tasks rely on ranking the data items based on their centrality or prestige in the network . beyond prestige , diversity has been recognized as a crucial objective in ranking , aiming at providing a non-redundant and high coverage piece of information in the top ranked results . nevertheless , existing network-based ranking approaches either disregard the concern of diversity , or handle it with non-optimized heuristics , usually based on greedy vertex selection . we propose a novel ranking algorithm , divrank , based on a reinforced random walk in an information network . this model automatically balances the prestige and the diversity of the top ranked vertices in a principled way . divrank not only has a clear optimization explanation , but also well connects to classical models in mathematics and network science . we evaluate divrank using empirical experiments on three different networks as well as a text summarization task . divrank outperforms existing network-based ranking methods in terms of enhancing diversity in prestige .

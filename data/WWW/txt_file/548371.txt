ctr-s : a logic for specifying contracts in semantic web services a requirements analysis in the emerging field of semantic web services ( sws ) ( see http:\/\/daml.org\/services\/swsl\/requirements\/ ) has identified four major areas of research : intelligent service discovery , automated contracting of services , process modeling , and service enactment . this paper deals with the intersection of two of these areas : process modeling as it pertains to automated contracting . specifically , we propose a logic , called ctr-s , which captures the dynamic aspects of contracting for services . since ctr-s is an extension of the classical first-order logic , it is well-suited to model the static aspects of contracting as well . a distinctive feature of contracting is that it involves two or more parties in a potentially adversarial situation . ctr-s is designed to model this adversarial situation through its novel model theory , which incorporates certain game-theoretic concepts . in addition to the model theory , we develop a proof theory for ctr-s and demonstrate the use of the logic formodeling and reasoning about web service contracts .

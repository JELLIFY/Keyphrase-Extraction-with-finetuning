dynammo : mining and summarization of coevolving sequences with missing values given multiple time sequences with missing values , we propose dynammo which summarizes , compresses , and finds latent variables . the idea is to discover hidden variables and learn their dynamics , making our algorithm able to function even when there are missing values . we performed experiments on both real and synthetic datasets spanning several megabytes , including motion capture sequences and chlorine levels in drinking water . we show that our proposed dynammo method ( a ) can successfully learn the latent variables and their evolution ; ( b ) can provide high compression for little loss of reconstruction accuracy ; ( c ) can extract compact but powerful features for segmentation , interpretation , and forecasting ; ( d ) has complexity linear on the duration of sequences .

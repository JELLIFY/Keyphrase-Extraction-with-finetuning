visualizing differences in web search algorithms using the expected weighted hoeffding distance we introduce a new dissimilarity function for ranked lists , the expected weighted hoeffding distance , that has several advantages over current dissimilarity measures for ranked search results . first , it is easily customized for users who pay varying degrees of attention to websites at different ranks . second , unlike existing measures such as generalized kendall 's tau , it is based on a true metric , preserving meaningful embeddings when visualization techniques like multi-dimensional scaling are applied . third , our measure can effectively handle partial or missing rank information while retaining a probabilistic interpretation . finally , the measure can be made computationally tractable and we give a highly efficient algorithm for computing it . we then apply our new metric with multi-dimensional scaling to visualize and explore relationships between the result sets from different search engines , showing how the weighted hoeffding distance can distinguish important differences in search engine behavior that are not apparent with other rank-distance metrics . such visualizations are highly effective at summarizing and analyzing insights on which search engines to use , what search strategies users can employ , and how search results evolve over time . we demonstrate our techniques using a collection of popular search engines , a representative set of queries , and frequently used query manipulation methods .

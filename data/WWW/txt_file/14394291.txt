practical end-to-end web content integrity widespread growth of open wireless hotspots has made it easy to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks and impersonate web sites . although https can be used to prevent such attacks , its universal adoption is hindered by its performance cost and its inability to leverage caching at intermediate servers ( such as cdn servers and caching proxies ) while maintaining end-to-end security . to complement https , we revive an old idea from shttp , a protocol that offers end-to-end web integrity without confidentiality . we name the protocol httpi and give it an efficient design that is easy to deploy for today 's web . in particular , we tackle several previously-unidentified challenges , such as supporting progressive page loading on the client 's browser , handling mixed content , and defining access control policies among http , httpi , and https content from the same domain . our prototyping and evaluation experience show that httpi incurs negligible performance overhead over http , can leverage existing web infrastructure such as cdns or caching proxies without any modifications to them , and can make many of the mixed-content problems in existing https web sites easily go away . based on this experience , we advocate browser and web server vendors to adopt httpi .

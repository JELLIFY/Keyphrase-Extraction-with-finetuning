mining intrusion detection alarms for actionable knowledge in response to attacks against enterprise networks , administrators increasingly deploy intrusion detection systems . these systems monitor hosts , networks , and other resources for signs of security violations . the use of intrusion detection has given rise to another difficult problem , namely the handling of a generally large number of alarms . in this paper , we mine historical alarms to learn how future alarms can be handled more efficiently . first , we investigate episode rules with respect to their suitability in this approach . we report the difficulties encountered and the unexpected insights gained . in addition , we introduce a new conceptual clustering technique , and use it in extensive experiments with real-world data to show that intrusion detection alarms can be handled efficiently by using previously mined knowledge .

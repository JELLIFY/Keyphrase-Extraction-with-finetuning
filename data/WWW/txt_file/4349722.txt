discovering the best web service major research challenges in discovering web services include , provisioning of services across multiple or heterogeneous registries , differentiating between services that share similar functionalities , improving end-to-end quality of service ( qos ) , and enabling clients to customize the discovery process . proliferation and interoperability of this multitude of web services have lead to the emergence of new standards on how services can be published , discovered , or used ( i.e. uddi , wsdl , soap ) . such standards can potentially provide many of these features and much more , however , there are technical challenges associated with existing standards . one of these challenges is the client . s ability to control the discovery process across accessible service registries for finding services of interest . this work proposes a solution to this problem and introduces the web service relevancy function ( wsrf ) used for measuring the relevancy ranking of a particular web service based on qos metrics and client preferences . we present experimental validation , results , and analysis of the presented ideas .

ranking refinement and its application to information retrieval we consider the problem of ranking refinement , i.e. , to improve the accuracy of an existing ranking function with a small set of labeled instances . we are , particularly , interested in learning a better ranking function using two complementary sources of information , ranking information given by the existing ranking function ( i.e. , a base ranker ) and that obtained from users ' feedbacks . this problem is very important in information retrieval where the feedback is gradually collected . the key challenge in combining the two sources of information arises from the fact that the ranking information presented by the base ranker tends to be imperfect and the ranking information obtained from users ' feedbacks tends to be noisy . we present a novel boosting framework for ranking refinement that can effectively leverage the uses of the two sources of information . our empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for ranking refinement , and furthermore significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms that incorporate the outputs from the base ranker as an additional feature .

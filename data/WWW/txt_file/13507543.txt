a class-feature-centroid classifier for text categorization automated text categorization is an important technique for many web applications , such as document indexing , document filtering , and cataloging web resources . many different approaches have been proposed for the automated text categorization problem . among them , centroid-based approaches have the advantages of short training time and testing time due to its computational efficiency . as a result , centroid-based classifiers have been widely used in many web applications . however , the accuracy of centroid-based classifiers is inferior to svm , mainly because centroids found during construction are far from perfect locations . we design a fast class-feature-centroid ( cfc ) classifier for multi-class , single-label text categorization . in cfc , a centroid is built from two important class distributions : inter-class term index and inner-class term index . cfc proposes a novel combination of these indices and employs a denormalized cosine measure to calculate the similarity score between a text vector and a centroid . experiments on the reuters-21578 corpus and 20-newsgroup email collection show that cfc consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art svm classifiers on both micro-f1 and macro-f1 scores . particularly , cfc is more effective and robust than svm when data is sparse .

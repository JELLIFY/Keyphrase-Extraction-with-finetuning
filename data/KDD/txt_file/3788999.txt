information genealogy : uncovering the flow of ideas in non-hyperlinked document databases we now have incrementally-grown databases of text documents ranging back for over a decade in areas ranging from personal email , to news-articles and conference proceedings . while accessing individual documents is easy , methods for overviewing and understanding these collections as a whole are lacking in number and in scope . in this paper , we address one such global analysis task , namely the problem of automatically uncovering how ideas spread through the collection over time . we refer to this problem as information genealogy . in contrast to bibliometric methods that are limited to collections with explicit citation structure , we investigate content-based methods requiring only the text and timestamps of the documents . in particular , we propose a language-modeling approach and a likelihood ratio test to detect influence between documents in a statistically well-founded way . furthermore , we show how this method can be used to infer citation graphs and to identify the most influential documents in the collection . experiments on the nips conference proceedings and the physics arxiv show that our method is more effective than methods based on document similarity .

a sequential dual method for large scale multi-class linear svms efficient training of direct multi-class formulations of linear support vector machines is very useful in applications such as text classification with a huge number examples as well as features . this paper presents a fast dual method for this training . the main idea is to sequentially traverse through the training set and optimize the dual variables associated with one example at a time . the speed of training is enhanced further by shrinking and cooling heuristics . experiments indicate that our method is much faster than state of the art solvers such as bundle , cutting plane and exponentiated gradient methods .

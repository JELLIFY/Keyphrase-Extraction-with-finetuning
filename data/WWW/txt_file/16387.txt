a software framework for matchmaking based on semantic web technology an important objective of the semantic web is to make electronic commerce interactions more flexible and automated . to achieve this , standardization of ontologies , message content and message protocols will be necessary . in this paper we investigate how semantic and web services technologies can be used to support service advertisement and discovery in e-commerce . in particular , we describe the design and implementation of a service matchmaking prototype which uses a daml-s based ontology and a description logic reasoner to compare ontology based service descriptions . we also present the results of initial experiments testing the performance of this prototype implementation in a realistic agent based e-commerce scenario .

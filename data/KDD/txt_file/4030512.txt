mining , indexing , and querying historical spatiotemporal data in many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data , movements obey periodic patterns ; the objects follow the same routes ( approximately ) over regular time intervals . for example , people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the same route to their work everyday . the discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data , apart from unveiling important information to the data analyst , can facilitate data management substantially . based on this observation , we propose a framework that analyzes , manages , and queries object movements that follow such patterns . we define the spatiotemporal periodic pattern mining problem and propose an effective and fast mining algorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns . we also devise a novel , specialized index structure that can benefit from the discovered patterns to support more efficient execution of spatiotemporal queries . we evaluate our methods experimentally using datasets with object trajectories that exhibit periodicity .

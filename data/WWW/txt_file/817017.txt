towards content trust of web resources trust is an integral part of the semantic web architecture . while most prior work focuses on entity-centered issues such as authentication and reputation , it does not model the content , i.e. the nature and use of the information being exchanged . this paper discusses content trust as an aggregate of other trust measures that have been previously studied . the paper introduces several factors that users consider in deciding whether to trust the content provided by a web resource . many of these factors are hard to capture in practice , since they would require a large amount of user input . our goal is to discern which of these factors could be captured in practice with minimal user interaction in order to maximize the system 's trust estimates . the paper also describes a simulation environment that we have designed to study alternative models of content trust .

discovering associations with numeric variables this paper further develops aumann and lindell 's ( 3 ) proposal for a variant of association rules for which the consequent is a numeric variable . it is argued that these rules can discover useful interactions with numeric data that can not be discovered directly using traditional association rules with discretization . alternative measures for identifying interesting rules are proposed . efficient algorithms are presented that enable these rules to be discovered for dense data sets for which application of auman and lindell 's algorithm is infeasible .

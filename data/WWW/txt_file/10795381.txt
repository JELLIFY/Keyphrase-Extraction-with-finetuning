facetedpedia : dynamic generation of query-dependent faceted interfaces for wikipedia this paper proposes facetedpedia , a faceted retrieval system for information discovery and exploration in wikipedia . given the set of wikipedia articles resulting from a keyword query , facetedpedia generates a faceted interface for navigating the result articles . compared with other faceted retrieval systems , facetedpedia is fully automatic and dynamic in both facet generation and hierarchy construction , and the facets are based on the rich semantic information from wikipedia . the essence of our approach is to build upon the collaborative vocabulary in wikipedia , more specifically the intensive internal structures ( hyperlinks ) and folksonomy ( category system ) . given the sheer size and complexity of this corpus , the space of possible choices of faceted interfaces is prohibitively large . we propose metrics for ranking individual facet hierarchies by user 's navigational cost , and metrics for ranking interfaces ( each with k facets ) by both their average pairwise similarities and average navigational costs . we thus develop faceted interface discovery algorithms that optimize the ranking metrics . our experimental evaluation and user study verify the effectiveness of the system .

detecting graph-based spatial outliers : algorithms and applications ( a summary of results ) identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of unexpected , interesting , and useful knowledge . existing methods are designed for detecting spatial outliers in multidimensional geometric data sets , where a distance metric is available . in this paper , we focus on detecting spatial outliers in graph structured data sets . we define statistical tests , analyze the statistical foundation underlying our approach , design several fast algorithms to detect spatial outliers , and provide a cost model for outlier detection procedures . in addition , we provide experimental results from the application of our algorithms on a minneapolis-st . paul ( twin cities ) traffic dataset to show their effectiveness and usefulness .

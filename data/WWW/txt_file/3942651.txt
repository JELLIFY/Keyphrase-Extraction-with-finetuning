scalable techniques for memory-efficient cdn simulations since cdn simulations are known to be highly memory-intensive , in this paper , we argue the need for reducing the memory requirements of such simulations . we propose a novel memory-efficient data structure that stores cache state for a small subset of popular objects accurately and uses approximations for storing the state for the remaining objects . since popular objects receive a large fraction of the requests while less frequently accessed objects consume much of the memory space , this approach yields large memory savings and reduces errors . we use bloom filters to store approximate state and show that careful choice of parameters can substantially reduce the probability of errors due to approximations . we implement our techniques into a user library for constructing proxy caches in cdn simulators . our experimental results show up to an order of magnitude reduction in memory requirements of cdn simulations , while incurring a 5-10 % error .

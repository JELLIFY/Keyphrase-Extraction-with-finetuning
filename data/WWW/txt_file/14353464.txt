modeling click-through based word-pairs for web search statistical translation models and latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) are two effective approaches to exploit click-through data for web search ranking . this paper presents two document ranking models that combine both approaches by explicitly modeling word-pairs . the first model , called pairmodel , is a monolingual ranking model based on word pairs that are derived from click-through data . it maps queries and documents into a concept space spanned by these word pairs . the second model , called bilingual paired topic model ( bptm ) , uses bilingual word pairs and jointly models a bilingual query-document collection . this model maps queries and documents in multiple languages into a lower dimensional semantic subspace . experimental results on web search task show that they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baseline models , and the best result is obtained by interpolating pairmodel and bptm .

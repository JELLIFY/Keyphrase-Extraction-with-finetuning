measuring a commercial content delivery network content delivery networks ( cdns ) have become a crucial part of the modern web infrastructure . this paper studies the performance of the leading content delivery provider - akamai . it measures the performance of the current akamai platform and considers a key architectural question faced by both cdn designers and their prospective customers : whether the co-location approach to cdn platforms adopted by akamai , which tries to deploy servers in numerous internet locations , brings inherent performance benefits over a more consolidated data center approach pursued by other influential cdns such as limelight . we believe the methodology we developed for this study will be useful for other researchers in the cdn arena .

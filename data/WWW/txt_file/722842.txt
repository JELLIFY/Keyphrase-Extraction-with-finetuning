ensuring required failure atomicity of composite web services the recent evolution of internet , driven by the web services technology , is extending the role of the web from a support of information interaction to a middleware for b2b interactions . indeed , the web services technology allows enterprises to outsource parts of their business processes using web services . and it also provides the opportunity to dynamically offer new value-added services through the composition of pre-existing web services . in spite of the growing interest in web services , current technologies are found lacking efficient transactional support for composite web services ( css ) . in this paper , we propose a transactional approach to ensure the failure atomicity , of a cs , required by partners . we use the accepted termination states ( ats ) property as a mean to express the required failure atomicity . partners specify their cs , mainly its control flow , and the required ats . then , we use a set of transactional rules to assist designers to compose a valid cs with regards to the specified ats .

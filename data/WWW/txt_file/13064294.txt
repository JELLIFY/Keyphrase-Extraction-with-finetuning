ontotrix : a hybrid visualization for populated ontologies most semantic web data visualization tools structure the representation according to the concept definitions and interrelations that constitute the ontology 's vocabulary . instances are often treated as somewhat peripheral information , when considered at all . these instances , that populate ontologies , represent an essential part of any knowledge base , and are often orders of magnitude more numerous than the concept definitions that give them machine-processable meaning . we present a visualization technique designed to enable users to visualize large instance sets and the relations that connect them . this hybrid visualization uses both node-link and adjacency matrix representations of graphs to visualize different parts of the data depending on their semantic and local structural properties , exploiting ontological knowledge to drive the graph layout . the representation is embedded in an environment that features advanced interaction techniques for easy navigation , including support for smooth continuous zooming and coordinated views .

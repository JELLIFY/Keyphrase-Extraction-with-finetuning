knowledge-based data mining we describe techniques for combining two types of knowledge systems : expert and machine learning . both the expert system and the learning system represent information by logical decision rules or trees . unlike the classical views of knowledge-base evaluation or refinement , our view accepts the contents of the knowledge base as completely correct . the knowledge base and the results of its stored cases will provide direction for the discovery of new relationships in the form of newly induced decision rules . an expert system called seas was built to discover sales leads for computer products and solutions . the system interviews executives by asking questions , and based on the responses , recommends products that may improve a business ' operations . leveraging this expert system , we record the results of the interviews and the program 's recommendations . the very same data stored by the expert system is used to find new predictive rules . among the potential advantages of this approach are ( a ) the capability to spot new sales trends and ( b ) the substitution of less expensive probabilistic rules that use database data instead of interviews .

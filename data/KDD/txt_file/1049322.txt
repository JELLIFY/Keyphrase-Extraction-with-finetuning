paintingclass : interactive construction , visualization and exploration of decision trees decision trees are commonly used for classification . we propose to use decision trees not just for classification but also for the wider purpose of knowledge discovery , because visualizing the decision tree can reveal much valuable information in the data . we introduce paintingclass , a system for interactive construction , visualization and exploration of decision trees . paintingclass provides an intuitive layout and convenient navigation of the decision tree . paintingclass also provides the user the means to interactively construct the decision tree . each node in the decision tree is displayed as a visual projection of the data . through actual examples and comparison with other classification methods , we show that the user can effectively use paintingclass to construct a decision tree and explore the decision tree to gain additional knowledge .

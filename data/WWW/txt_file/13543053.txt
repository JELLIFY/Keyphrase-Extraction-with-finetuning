visual diversification of image search results due to the reliance on the textual information associated with an image , image search engines on the web lack the discriminative power to deliver visually diverse search results . the textual descriptions are key to retrieve relevant results for a given user query , but at the same time provide little information about the rich image content . in this paper we investigate three methods for visual diversification of image search results . the methods deploy lightweight clustering techniques in combination with a dynamic weighting function of the visual features , to best capture the discriminative aspects of the resulting set of images that is retrieved . a representative image is selected from each cluster , which together form a diverse result set . based on a performance evaluation we find that the outcome of the methods closely resembles human perception of diversity , which was established in an extensive clustering experiment carried out by human assessors .

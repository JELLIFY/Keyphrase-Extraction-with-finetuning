the webgraph framework i : compression techniques studying web graphs is often difficult due to their large size . recently , several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow tostore a web graph in memory in a limited space , exploiting the inner redundancies of the web . the webgraph framework is a suite of codes , algorithms and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs . this papers presents the compression techniques used in webgraph , which are centred around referentiation and intervalisation ( which in turn are dual to each other ) . webgraph can compress the webbase graph ( 118 mnodes , 1 glinks ) in as little as 3.08 bits per link , and its transposed version in as littleas 2.89 bits per link .

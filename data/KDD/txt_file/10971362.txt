classification of software behaviors for failure detection : a discriminative pattern mining approach software is a ubiquitous component of our daily life . we often depend on the correct working of software systems . due to the difficulty and complexity of software systems , bugs and anomalies are prevalent . bugs have caused billions of dollars loss , in addition to privacy and security threats . in this work , we address software reliability issues by proposing a novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs . with the technique , it is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures and anomalies . our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitive series of events from program execution traces . it then performs feature selection to select the best features for classification . these features are then used to train a classifier to detect failures . experiments and case studies on traces of several benchmark software systems and a real-life concurrency bug from mysql server show the utility of the technique in capturing failures and anomalies . on average , our pattern-based classification technique outperforms the baseline approach by 24.68 % in accuracy .

object-level ranking : bringing order to web objects in contrast with the current web search methods that essentially do document-level ranking and retrieval , we are exploring a new paradigm to enable web search at the object level . we collect web information for objects relevant for a specific application domain and rank these objects in terms of their relevance and popularity to answer user queries . traditional pagerank model is no longer valid for object popularity calculation because of the existence of heterogeneous relationships between objects . this paper introduces poprank , a domain-independent object-level link analysis model to rank the objects within a specific domain . specifically we assign a popularity propagation factor to each type of object relationship , study how different popularity propagation factors for these heterogeneous relationships could affect the popularity ranking , and propose efficient approaches to automatically decide these factors . our experiments are done using 1 million cs papers , and the experimental results show that poprank can achieve significantly better ranking results than naively applying pagerank on the object graph .

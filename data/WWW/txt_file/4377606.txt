mapping-driven xml transformation clio is an existing schema-mapping tool that provides user-friendly means to manage and facilitate the complex task of transformation and integration of heterogeneous data such as xml over the web or in xml databases . by means of mappings from source to target schemas , clio can help users conveniently establish the precise semantics of data transformation and integration . in this paper we study the problem of how to efficiently implement such data transformation ( i.e. , generating target data from the source data based on schema mappings ) . we present a three-phase framework for high-performance xml-to-xml transformation based on schema mappings , and discuss methodologies and algorithms for implementing these phases . in particular , we elaborate on novel techniques such as streamed extraction of mapped source values and scalable disk-based merging of overlapping data ( including duplicate elimination ) . we compare our transformation framework with alternative methods such as using xquery or sql\/xml provided by current commercial databases . the results demonstrate that the three-phase framework ( although as simple as it is ) is highly scalable and outperforms the alternative methods by orders of magnitude .

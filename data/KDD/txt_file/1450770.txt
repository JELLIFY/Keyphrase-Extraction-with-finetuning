incremental context mining for adaptive document classification automatic document classification ( dc ) is essential for the management of information and knowledge . this paper explores two practical issues in dc : ( 1 ) each document has its context of discussion , and ( 2 ) both the content and vocabulary of the document database is intrinsically evolving . the issues call for adaptive document classification ( adc ) that adapts a dc system to the evolving contextual requirement of each document category , so that input documents may be classified based on their contexts of discussion . we present an incremental context mining technique to tackle the challenges of adc . theoretical analyses and empirical results show that , given a text hierarchy , the mining technique is efficient in incrementally maintaining the evolving contextual requirement of each category . based on the contextual requirements mined by the system , higher-precision dc may be achieved with better efficiency .

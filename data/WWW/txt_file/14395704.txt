a dual-mode user interface for accessing 3d content on the world wide web the web evolved from a text-based system to the current rich and interactive medium that supports images , 2d graphics , audio and video . the major media type that is still missing is 3d graphics . although various approaches have been proposed ( most notably vrml\/x3d ) , they have not been widely adopted . one reason for the limited acceptance is the lack of 3d interaction techniques that are optimal for the hypertext-based web interface . we present a novel strategy for accessing integrated information spaces , where hypertext and 3d graphics data are simultaneously available and linked . we introduce a user interface that has two modes between which a user can switch anytime : the driven by simple hypertext-based interactions `` do n't - make-me-think '' mode , where a 3d scene is embedded in hypertext and the more immersive 3d `` take-me-to-the-wonderland '' mode , which immerses the hypertextual annotations into the 3d scene . a user study is presented , which characterizes the user interface in terms of its efficiency and usability .

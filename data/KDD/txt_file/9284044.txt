factorization meets the neighborhood : a multifaceted collaborative filtering model recommender systems provide users with personalized suggestions for products or services . these systems often rely on collaborating filtering ( cf ) , where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products . the two more successful approaches to cf are latent factor models , which directly profile both users and products , and neighborhood models , which analyze similarities between products or users . in this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches . the factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged , thereby building a more accurate combined model . further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users . the methods are tested on the netflix data . results are better than those previously published on that dataset . in addition , we suggest a new evaluation metric , which highlights the differences among methods , based on their performance at a top-k recommendation task .

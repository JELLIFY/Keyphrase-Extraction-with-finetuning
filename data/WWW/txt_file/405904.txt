web ontology segmentation : analysis , classification and use ontologies are at the heart of the semantic web . they define the concepts and relationships that make global interoperability possible . however , as these ontologies grow in size they become more and more difficult to create , use , understand , maintain , transform and classify . we present and evaluate several algorithms for extracting relevant segments out of large description logic ontologies for the purposes of increasing tractability for both humans and computers . the segments are not mere fragments , but stand alone as ontologies in their own right . this technique takes advantage of the detailed semantics captured within an owl ontology to produce highly relevant segments . the research was evaluated using the galen ontology of medical terms and procedures .

highly efficient algorithms for structural clustering of large websites in this paper , we present a highly scalable algorithm for structurally clustering webpages for extraction . we show that , using only the urls of the webpages and simple content features , it is possible to cluster webpages effectively and efficiently . at the heart of our techniques is a principled framework , based on the principles of information theory , that allows us to effectively leverage the urls , and combine them with content and structural properties . using an extensive evaluation over several large full websites , we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques , at a scale unattainable by previous techniques .

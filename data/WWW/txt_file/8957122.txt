efficient structural joins with on-the-fly indexing previous work on structural joins mostly focuses on maintaining offline indexes on disks . most of them also require the elements in both sets to be sorted . in this paper , we study an on-the-fly , in-memory indexing approach to structural joins . there is no need to sort the elements or maintain indexes on disks . we identify the similarity between the structural join problem and the stabbing query problem , and extend a main memory-based indexing technique for stabbing queries to structural joins .

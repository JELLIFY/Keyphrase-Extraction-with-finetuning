mining sequential patterns from probabilistic databases we consider sequential pattern mining in situations where there is uncertainty about which source an event is associated with . we model this in the probabilistic database framework and consider the problem of enumerating all sequences whose expected support is sufficiently large . unlike frequent itemset mining in probabilistic databases ( c. aggarwal et al. . kdd ' 09 ; chui et al. , pakdd ' 07 ; chui and kao , pakdd ' 08 ) , we use dynamic programming ( dp ) to compute the probability that a source supports a sequence , and show that this suffices to compute the expected support of a sequential pattern . next , we embed this dp algorithm into candidate generate-and-test approaches , and explore the pattern lattice both in a breadth-first ( similar to gsp ) and a depth-first ( similar to spam ) manner . we propose optimizations for efficiently computing the frequent 1-sequences , for re-using previously-computed results through incremental support computation , and for elmiminating candidate sequences without computing their support via probabilistic pruning . preliminary experiments show that our optimizations are effective in improving the cpu cost .

exploit sequencing views in semantic cache to accelerate xpath query evaluation in xml databases , materializing queries and their results into views in a semantic cache can improve the performance of query evaluation by reducing computational complexity and i\/o cost . although there are a number of proposals of semantic cache for xml queries , the issues of fast cache lookup and compensation query construction could be further studied . in this paper , based on sequential xpath queries , we propose fastclu , a fast cache lookup algorithm and efficq , an efficient compensation query constructing algorithm to solve these two problems . experimental results show that our algorithms outperform previous algorithms and can achieve good performance of query evaluation .

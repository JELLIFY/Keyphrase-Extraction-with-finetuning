variable latent semantic indexing latent semantic indexing is a classical method to produce optimal low-rank approximations of a term-document matrix . however , in the context of a particular query distribution , the approximation thus produced need not be optimal . we propose vlsi , a new query-dependent ( or `` variable '' ) low-rank approximation that minimizes approximation error for any specified query distribution . with this tool , it is possible to tailor the lsi technique to particular settings , often resulting in vastly improved approximations at much lower dimensionality . we validate this method via a series of experiments on classical corpora , showing that vlsi typically performs similarly to lsi with an order of magnitude fewer dimensions .

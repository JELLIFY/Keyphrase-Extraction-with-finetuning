privacy preserving regression modelling via distributed computation reluctance of data owners to share their possibly confidential or proprietary data with others who own related databases is a serious impediment to conducting a mutually beneficial data mining analysis . we address the case of vertically partitioned data -- multiple data owners\/agencies each possess a few attributes of every data record . we focus on the case of the agencies wanting to conduct a linear regression analysis with complete records without disclosing values of their own attributes . this paper describes an algorithm that enables such agencies to compute the exact regression coefficients of the global regression equation and also perform some basic goodness-of-fit diagnostics while protecting the confidentiality of their data . in more general settings beyond the privacy scenario , this algorithm can also be viewed as method for the distributed computation for regression analyses .

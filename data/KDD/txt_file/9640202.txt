drosophila gene expression pattern annotation using sparse features and term-term interactions the drosophila gene expression pattern images document the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression and they are valuable tools for explicating the gene functions , interaction , and networks during drosophila embryogenesis . to provide text-based pattern searching , the images in the berkeley drosophila genome project ( bdgp ) study are annotated with ontology terms manually by human curators . we present a systematic approach for automating this task , because the number of images needing text descriptions is now rapidly increasing . we consider both improved feature representation and novel learning formulation to boost the annotation performance . for feature representation , we adapt the bag-of-words scheme commonly used in visual recognition problems so that the image group information in the bdgp study is retained . moreover , images from multiple views can be integrated naturally in this representation . to reduce the quantization error caused by the bag-of-words representation , we propose an improved feature representation scheme based on the sparse learning technique . in the design of learning formulation , we propose a local regularization framework that can incorporate the correlations among terms explicitly . we further show that the resulting optimization problem admits an analytical solution . experimental results show that the representation based on sparse learning outperforms the bag-of-words representation significantly . results also show that incorporation of the term-term correlations improves the annotation performance consistently .

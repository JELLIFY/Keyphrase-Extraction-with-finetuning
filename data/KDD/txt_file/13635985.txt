clustering based large margin classification : a scalable approach using socp formulation this paper presents a novel second order cone programming ( socp ) formulation for large scale binary classification tasks . assuming that the class conditional densities are mixture distributions , where each component of the mixture has a spherical covariance , the second order statistics of the components can be estimated efficiently using clustering algorithms like birch . for each cluster , the second order moments are used to derive a second order cone constraint via a chebyshev-cantelli inequality . this constraint ensures that any data point in the cluster is classified correctly with a high probability . this leads to a large margin socp formulation whose size depends on the number of clusters rather than the number of training data points . hence , the proposed formulation scales well for large datasets when compared to the state-of-the-art classifiers , support vector machines ( svms ) . experiments on real world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms svm solvers in terms of training time and achieves similar accuracies .

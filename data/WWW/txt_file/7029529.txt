analyzing search engine advertising : firm behavior and cross-selling in electronic markets the phenomenon of sponsored search advertising is gaining ground as the largest source of revenues for search engines . firms across different industries have are beginning to adopt this as the primary form of online advertising . this process works on an auction mechanism in which advertisers bid for different keywords , and final rank for a given keyword is allocated by the search engine . but how different are firm 's actual bids from their optimal bids ? moreover , what are other ways in which firms can potentially benefit from sponsored search advertising ? based on the model and estimates from prior work ( 10 ) , we conduct a number of policy simulations in order to investigate to what extent an advertiser can benefit from bidding optimally for its keywords . further , we build a hierarchical bayesian modeling framework to explore the potential for cross-selling or spillovers effects from a given keyword advertisement across multiple product categories , and estimate the model using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods . our analysis suggests that advertisers are not bidding optimally with respect to maximizing profits . we conduct a detailed analysis with product level variables to explore the extent of cross-selling opportunities across different categories from a given keyword advertisement . we find that there exists significant potential for cross-selling through search keyword advertisements in that consumers often end up buying products from other categories in addition to the product they were searching for . latency ( the time it takes for consumer to place a purchase order after clicking on the advertisement ) and the presence of a brand name in the keyword are associated with consumer spending on product categories that are different from the one they were originally searching for on the internet .

a web page prediction model based on click-stream tree representation of user behavior predicting the next request of a user as she visits web pages has gained importance as web-based activity increases . markov models and their variations , or models based on sequence mining have been found well suited for this problem . however , higher order markov models are extremely complicated due to their large number of states whereas lower order markov models do not capture the entire behavior of a user in a session . the models that are based on sequential pattern mining only consider the frequent sequences in the data set , making it difficult to predict the next request following a page that is not in the sequential pattern . furthermore , it is hard to find models for mining two different kinds of information of a user session . we propose a new model that considers both the order information of pages in a session and the time spent on them . we cluster user sessions based on their pair-wise similarity and represent the resulting clusters by a click-stream tree . the new user session is then assigned to a cluster based on a similarity measure . the click-stream tree of that cluster is used to generate the recommendation set . the model can be used as part of a cache prefetching system as well as a recommendation model .

making rdf presentable : integrated global and local semantic web browsing this paper discusses generating document structure from annotated media repositories in a domain-independent manner . this approaches the vision of a universal rdf browser . we start by applying the search-and-browse paradigm established for the www to rdf presentation . furthermore , this paper adds to this paradigm the clustering-based derivation of document structure from search returns , providing simple but domain-independent hypermedia generation from rdf stores . while such generated presentations hardly meet the standards of those written by humans , they provide quick access to media repositories when the required document has not yet been written . the resulting system allows a user to specify a topic for which it generates a hypermedia document providing guided navigation through virtually any rdf repository . the impact for content providers is that as soon as one adds new media items and their annotations to a repository , they become immediately available for automatic integration into subsequently requested presentations .

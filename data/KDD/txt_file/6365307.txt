a generative probabilistic approach to visualizing sets of symbolic sequences there is a notable interest in extending probabilistic generative modeling principles to accommodate for more complex structured data types . in this paper we develop a generative probabilistic model for visualizing sets of discrete symbolic sequences . the model , a constrained mixture of discrete hidden markov models , is a generalization of density-based visualization methods previously developed for static data sets . we illustrate our approach on sequences representing web-log data and chorals by j.s. bach .

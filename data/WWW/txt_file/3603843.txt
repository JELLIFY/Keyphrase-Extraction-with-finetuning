modeling the author bias between two on-line computer science citation databases we examine the difference and similarities between two on-line computer science citation databases dblp and citeseer . the database entries in dblp are inserted manually while the citeseer entries are obtained autonomously . we show that the citeseer database contains considerably fewer single author papers . this bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive explanation . the model permits us to predict that the dblp database covers approximately 30 % of the entire literature of computer science .

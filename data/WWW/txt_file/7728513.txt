exploring social annotations for information retrieval social annotation has gained increasing popularity in many web-based applications , leading to an emerging research area in text analysis and information retrieval . this paper is concerned with developing probabilistic models and computational algorithms for social annotations . we propose a unified framework to combine the modeling of social annotations with the language modeling-based methods for information retrieval . the proposed approach consists of two steps : ( 1 ) discovering topics in the contents and annotations of documents while categorizing the users by domains ; and ( 2 ) enhancing document and query language models by incorporating user domain interests as well as topical background models . in particular , we propose a new general generative model for social annotations , which is then simplified to a computationally tractable hierarchical bayesian network . then we apply smoothing techniques in a risk minimization framework to incorporate the topical information to language models . experiments are carried out on a real-world annotation data set sampled from del. icio . us . our results demonstrate significant improvements over the traditional approaches .

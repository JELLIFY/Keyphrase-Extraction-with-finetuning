statsnowball : a statistical approach to extracting entity relationships traditional relation extraction methods require pre-specified relations and relation-specific human-tagged examples . bootstrapping systems significantly reduce the number of training examples , but they usually apply heuristic-based methods to combine a set of strict hard rules , which limit the ability to generalize and thus generate a low recall . furthermore , existing bootstrapping methods do not perform open information extraction ( open ie ) , which can identify various types of relations without requiring pre-specifications . in this paper , we propose a statistical extraction framework called statistical snowball ( statsnowball ) , which is a bootstrapping system and can perform both traditional relation extraction and open ie . statsnowball uses the discriminative markov logic networks ( mlns ) and softens hard rules by learning their weights in a maximum likelihood estimate sense . mln is a general model , and can be configured to perform different levels of relation extraction . in statsnwoball , pattern selection is performed by solving an l1-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimation , which enjoys well-founded theories and efficient solvers . we extensively evaluate the performance of statsnowball in different configurations on both a small but fully labeled data set and large-scale web data . empirical results show that statsnowball can achieve a significantly higher recall without sacrificing the high precision during iterations with a small number of seeds , and the joint inference of mln can improve the performance . finally , statsnowball is efficient and we have developed a working entity relation search engine called renlifang based on it .

owl dl vs. owl flight : conceptual modeling and reasoning for the semantic web the semantic web languages rdfs and owl have been around for some time now . however , the presence of these languages has not brought the breakthrough of the semantic web the creators of the languages had hoped for . owl has a number of problems in the area of interoperability and usability in the context of many practical application scenarios which impede the connection to the software engineering and database communities . in this paper we present owl flight , which is loosely based on owl , but the semantics is grounded in logic programming rather than description logics , and it borrows the constraint-based modeling style common in databases . this results in different types of modeling primitives and enforces a different style of ontology modeling . we analyze the modeling paradigms of owl dl and owl flight , as well as reasoning tasks supported by both languages . we argue that different applications on the semantic web require different styles of modeling and thus both types of languages are required for the semantic web .

analyzing and accelerating web access in a school in peri-urban india while computers and internet access have growing penetration amongst schools in the developing world , intermittent connectivity and limited bandwidth often prevent them from being fully utilized by students and teachers . in this paper , we make two contributions to help address this problem . first , we characterize six weeks of http traffic from a primary school outside of bangalore , india , illuminating opportunities and constraints for improving performance in such settings . second , we deploy an aggressive caching and prefetching engine and show that it accelerates a user 's overall browsing experience ( apart from video content ) by 2.8 x. our accelerator leverages innovative techniques that have been proposed , but not evaluated in detail , including the effectiveness of serving stale pages , cached page highlighting , and client-side prefetching . unlike proxy-based techniques , our system is bundled as an open-source firefox plugin and runs directly on client machines . this allows easy installation and configuration by end users , which is especially important in developing regions where a lack of permissions or technical expertise often prevents modification of internal network settings .

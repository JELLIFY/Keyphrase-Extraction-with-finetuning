arrow : generating signatures to detect drive-by downloads a drive-by download attack occurs when a user visits a webpage which attempts to automatically download malware without the user 's consent . attackers sometimes use a malware distribution network ( mdn ) to manage a large number of malicious webpages , exploits , and malware executables . in this paper , we provide a new method to determine these mdns from the secondary urls and redirect chains recorded by a high-interaction client honeypot . in addition , we propose a novel drive-by download detection method . instead of depending on the malicious content used by previous methods , our algorithm first identifies and then leverages the urls of the mdn 's central servers , where a central server is a common server shared by a large percentage of the drive-by download attacks in the same mdn . a set of regular expression-based signatures are then generated based on the urls of each central server . this method allows additional malicious webpages to be identified which launched but failed to execute a successful drive-by download attack . the new drive-by detection system named arrow has been implemented , and we provide a large-scale evaluation on the output of a production drive-by detection system . the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , where the detection coverage has been boosted by 96 % with an extremely low false positive rate .

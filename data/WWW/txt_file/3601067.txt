using owl for querying an xml\/rdf syntax some recent initiatives try to take profit from rdf to make xml documents interoperate at the semantic level . ontologies are used to establish semantic connections among xml languages , and some mechanisms have been defined to query them with natural xml query languages like xpath and xml query . generally structure-mapping approaches define a simple translation between trivial xpath expressions and some rdf query language like rdql ; however some xpath constructs can not be covered in a structure-mapping strategy . in contrast , our work takes the model-mapping approach , respectful with node order , that allows mapping all xpath axis . the obtained xpath implementation has the properties of schema-awareness and idref-awareness , so it can be used to exploit inheritance hierarchies defined in one or more xml schemas .

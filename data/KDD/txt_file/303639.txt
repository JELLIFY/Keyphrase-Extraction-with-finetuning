model-based overlapping clustering while the vast majority of clustering algorithms are partitional , many real world datasets have inherently overlapping clusters . several approaches to finding overlapping clusters have come from work on analysis of biological datasets . in this paper , we interpret an overlapping clustering model proposed by segal et al. ( 23 ) as a generalization of gaussian mixture models , and we extend it to an overlapping clustering model based on mixtures of any regular exponential family distribution and the corresponding bregman divergence . we provide the necessary algorithm modifications for this extension , and present results on synthetic data as well as subsets of 20-newsgroups and eachmovie datasets .

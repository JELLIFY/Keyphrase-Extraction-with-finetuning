affinity rank : a new scheme for efficient web search maximizing only the relevance between queries and documents will not satisfy users if they want the top search results to present a wide coverage of topics by a few representative documents . in this paper , we propose two new metrics to evaluate the performance of information retrieval : diversity , which measures the topic coverage of a group of documents , and information richness , which measures the amount of information contained in a document . then we present a novel ranking scheme , affinity rank , which utilizes these two metrics to improve search results . we demonstrate how affinity rank works by a toy data set , and verify our method by experiments on real-world data sets .

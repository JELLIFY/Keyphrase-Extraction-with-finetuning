summarization of archived and shared personal photo collections the volume of personal photos hosted on photo archives and social sharing platforms has been increasing exponentially . it is difficult to get an overview of a large collection of personal photos without browsing though the entire database manually . in this research , we propose a framework to generate representative subset summaries from photo collections hosted on web archives or social networks . we define salient properties of an effective photo summary and model summarization as an optimization of these properties , given the size constraints . we also introduce metrics for evaluating photo summaries based on their information content and the ability to satisfy user 's information needs . our experiments show that our summarization framework performs better than baseline algorithms .

answering relationship queries on the web finding relationships between entities on the web , e.g. , the connections between different places or the commonalities of people , is a novel and challenging problem . existing web search engines excel in keyword matching and document ranking , but they can not well handle many relationship queries . this paper proposes a new method for answering relationship queries on two entities . our method first respectively retrieves the top web pages for either entity from a web search engine . it then matches these web pages and generates an ordered list of web page pairs . each web page pair consists of one web page for either entity . the top ranked web page pairs are likely to contain the relationships between the two entities . one main challenge in the ranking process is to effectively filter out the large amount of noise in the web pages without losing much useful information . to achieve this , our method assigns appropriate weights to terms in web pages and intelligently identifies the potential connecting terms that capture the relationships between the two entities . only those top potential connecting terms with large weights are used to rank web page pairs . finally , the top ranked web page pairs are presented to the searcher . for each such pair , the query terms and the top potential connecting terms are properly highlighted so that the relationships between the two entities can be easily identified . we implemented a prototype on top of the google search engine and evaluated it under a wide variety of query scenarios . the experimental results show that our method is effective at finding important relationships with low overhead .

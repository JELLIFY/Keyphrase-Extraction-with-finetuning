global distance-based segmentation of trajectories this work introduces distance-based criteria for segmentation of object trajectories . segmentation leads to simplification of the original objects into smaller , less complex primitives that are better suited for storage and retrieval purposes . previous work on trajectory segmentation attacked the problem locally , segmenting separately each trajectory of the database . therefore , they did not directly optimize the inter-object separability , which is necessary for mining operations such as searching , clustering , and classification on large databases . in this paper we analyze the trajectory segmentation problem from a global perspective , utilizing data aware distance-based optimization techniques , which optimize pairwise distance estimates hence leading to more efficient object pruning . we first derive exact solutions of the distance-based formulation . due to the intractable complexity of the exact solution , we present anapproximate , greedy solution that exploits forward searching of locally optimal solutions . since the greedy solution also imposes a prohibitive computational cost , we also put forward more light weight variance-based segmentation techniques , which intelligently `` relax '' the pairwise distance only in the areas that affect the least the mining operation .

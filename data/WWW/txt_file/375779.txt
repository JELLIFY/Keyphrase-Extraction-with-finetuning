ranking definitions with supervised learning methods this paper is concerned with the problem of definition search . specifically , given a term , we are to retrieve definitional excerpts of the term and rank the extracted excerpts according to their likelihood of being good definitions . this is in contrast to the traditional approaches of either generating a single combined definition or simply outputting all retrieved definitions . definition ranking is essential for the task . methods for performing definition ranking are proposed in this paper , which formalize the problem as either classification or ordinal regression . a specification for judging the goodness of a definition is given . we employ svm as the classification model and ranking svm as the ordinal regression model respectively , such that they rank definition candidates according to their likelihood of being good definitions . features for constructing the svm and ranking svm models are defined . an enterprise search system based on this method has been developed and has been put into practical use . experimental results indicate that the use of svm and ranking svm can significantly outperform the baseline methods of using heuristic rules or employing the conventional information retrieval method of okapi . this is true both when the answers are paragraphs and when they are sentences . experimental results also show that svm or ranking svm models trained in one domain can be adapted to another domain , indicating that generic models for definition ranking can be constructed .

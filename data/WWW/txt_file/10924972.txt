factorizing personalized markov chains for next-basket recommendation recommender systems are an important component of many websites . two of the most popular approaches are based on matrix factorization ( mf ) and markov chains ( mc ) . mf methods learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item preferences . on the other hand , mc methods model sequential behavior by learning a transition graph over items that is used to predict the next action based on the recent actions of a user . in this paper , we present a method bringing both approaches together . our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying markov chains . that means for each user an own transition matrix is learned - thus in total the method uses a transition cube . as the observations for estimating the transitions are usually very limited , our method factorizes the transition cube with a pairwise interaction model which is a special case of the tucker decomposition . we show that our factorized personalized mc ( fpmc ) model subsumes both a common markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model . for learning the model parameters , we introduce an adaption of the bayesian personalized ranking ( bpr ) framework for sequential basket data . empirically , we show that our fpmc model outperforms both the common matrix factorization and the unpersonalized mc model both learned with and without factorization .

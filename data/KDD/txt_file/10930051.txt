streaming feature selection using alpha-investing in streaming feature selection ( sfs ) , new features are sequentially considered for addition to a predictive model . when the space of potential features is large , sfs offers many advantages over traditional feature selection methods , which assume that all features are known in advance . features can be generated dynamically , focusing the search for new features on promising subspaces , and overfitting can be controlled by dynamically adjusting the threshold for adding features to the model . we describe α-investing , an adaptive complexity penalty method for sfs which dynamically adjusts the threshold on the error reduction required for adding a new feature . α-investing gives false discovery rate-style guarantees against overfitting . it differs from standard penalty methods such as aic , bic or ric , which always drastically over - or under-fit in the limit of infinite numbers of non-predictive features . empirical results show that sfs is competitive with much more compute-intensive feature selection methods such as stepwise regression , and allows feature selection on problems with over a million potential features .

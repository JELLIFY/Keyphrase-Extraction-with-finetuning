improvement of hits-based algorithms on web documents in this paper , we present two ways to improve the precision of hits-based algorithms on web documents . first , by analyzing the limitations of current hits-based algorithms , we propose a new weighted hits-based method that assigns appropriate weights to in-links of root documents . then , we combine content analysis with hits-based algorithms and study the effects of four representative relevance scoring methods , vsm , okapi , tls , and cdr , using a set of broad topic queries . our experimental results show that our weighted hits-based method performs significantly better than bharat 's improved hits algorithm . when we combine our weighted hits-based method or bharat 's hits algorithm with any of the four relevance scoring methods , the combined methods are only marginally better than our weighted hits-based method . between the four relevance-scoring methods , there is no significant quality difference when they are combined with a hits-based algorithm .

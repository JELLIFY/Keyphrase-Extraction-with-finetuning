hybrid multicasting in large-scale service networks the importance of service composition has been widely recognized in the internet research community due to its high flexibility in allowing development of customized applications . so far little attention has been paid to composite services ' runtime performance-related aspects , which are of great importance to wide-area applications . service composition in the wide area actually creates a new type of routing problem which we call qos service routing . we study this problem in large networks ( e.g. , the web ) and provide distributed and scalable routing solutions with various optimization goals . most importantly , we propose ways to reduce redundancies of data delivery and service execution through explorations of different types of multicast ( service multicast and data multicast ) in one-to-many application scenarios .

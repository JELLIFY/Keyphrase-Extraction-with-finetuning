efficient and robust streaming provisioning in vpns today , most large companies maintain virtual private networks ( vpns ) to connect their remote locations into a single secure network . vpns can be quite large covering more than 1000 locations and in most cases use standard internet protocols and services . such vpns are implemented using a diverse set of technologies such as frame relay , mpls , or ipsec to achieve the goal of privacy and performance isolation from the public internet . using vpns to distribute live content has recently received tremendous interest . for example , a vpn could be used to broadcast a ceo-employee town hall meeting . to distribute this type of content economically without overloading the network , the deployment of streaming caches or splitters is most likely required . in this paper , we address the problem of optimally placing such streaming splitters or caches to broadcast to a given set of vpn endpoints under the constraints typically found within a vpn . in particular , we introduce an efficient algorithm with complexity o ( v ) , v being the number of routers in the vpn . this guarantees the optimal cache placement if interception is used for redirection . we prove that the general problem is np-hard and introduce multiple heuristics for efficient and robust cache placement suitable under different constraints . at the expense of increased implementation complexity , each heuristic solution provides additional saving in the number of caches required . we evaluate proposed solutions using extensive simulations . in particular , we show our flow-based solution is very close to the optimal .

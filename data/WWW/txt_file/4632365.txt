multiway slca-based keyword search in xml data keyword search for smallest lowest common ancestors ( slcas ) in xml data has recently been proposed as a meaningful way to identify interesting data nodes inxml data where their subtrees contain an input set of keywords . in this paper , we generalize this useful search paradigm to support keyword search beyond the traditional and semantics to include both and and or boolean operators as well . we first analyze properties of the lca computation and propose improved algorithms to solve the traditional keyword search problem ( with only and semantics ) . we then extend our approach to handle general keyword search involving combinations of and and or boolean operators . the effectiveness of our new algorithms is demonstrated with a comprehensive experimental performance study .

applying data mining in investigating money laundering crimes in this paper , we study the problem of applying data mining to facilitate the investigation of money laundering crimes ( mlcs ) . we have identified a new paradigm of problems -- that of automatic community generation based on uni-party data , the data in which there is no direct or explicit link information available . consequently , we have proposed a new methodology for link discovery based on correlation analysis ( ldca ) . we have used mlc group model generation as an exemplary application of this problem paradigm , and have focused on this application to develop a specific method of automatic mlc group model generation based on timeline analysis using the ldca methodology , called coral . a prototype of coral method has been implemented , and preliminary testing and evaluations based on a real mlc case data are reported . the contributions of this work are : ( 1 ) identification of the uni-party data community generation problem paradigm , ( 2 ) proposal of a new methodology ldca to solve for problems in this paradigm , ( 3 ) formulation of the mlc group model generation problem as an example of this paradigm , ( 4 ) application of the ldca methodology in developing a specific solution ( coral ) to the mlc group model generation problem , and ( 5 ) development , evaluation , and testing of the coral prototype in a real mlc case data .

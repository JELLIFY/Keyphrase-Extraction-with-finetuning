web page summarization using dynamic content summarizing web pages have recently gained much attention from researchers . until now two main types of approaches have been proposed for this task : content - and context-based methods . both of them assume fixed content and characteristics of web documents without considering their dynamic nature . however the volatility of information published on the internet argue for the implementation of more time-aware techniques . this paper proposes a new approach towards automatic web page description , which extends the concept of a web page by the temporal dimension . our method provides a broader view on web document summarization and can complement the existing techniques .

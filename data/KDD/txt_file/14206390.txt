a gpu-tailored approach for training kernelized svms we present a method for efficiently training binary and multiclass kernelized svms on a graphics processing unit ( gpu ) . our methods apply to a broad range of kernels , including the popular gaus - sian kernel , on datasets as large as the amount of available memory on the graphics card . our approach is distinguished from earlier work in that it cleanly and efficiently handles sparse datasets through the use of a novel clustering technique . our optimization algorithm is also specifically designed to take advantage of the graphics hardware . this leads to different algorithmic choices then those preferred in serial implementations . our easy-to-use library is orders of magnitude faster then existing cpu libraries , and several times faster than prior gpu approaches .

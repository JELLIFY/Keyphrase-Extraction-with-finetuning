learning domain ontologies for web service descriptions : an experiment in bioinformatics the reasoning tasks that can be performed with semantic web service descriptions depend on the quality of the domain ontologies used to create these descriptions . however , building such domain ontologies is a time consuming and difficult task . we describe an automatic extraction method that learns domain ontologies for web service descriptions from textual documentations attached to web services . we conducted our experiments in the field of bioinformatics by learning an ontology from the documentation of the web services used in mygrid , a project that supports biology experiments on the grid . based on the evaluation of the extracted ontology in the context of the project , we conclude that the proposed extraction method is a helpful tool to support the process of building domain ontologies for web service descriptions .

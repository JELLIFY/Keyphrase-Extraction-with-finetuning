xspect : bridging open hypermedia and xlink this paper evaluates the xlink format in comparison with other linking formats . the comparison is based on xspect , an implementation of xlink . xspect handles transformation between an open hypermedia format ( ohif ) and xlink , and the paper discusses this isomorphic transformation and generalises it to include another open hypermedia format , fohm . the xspect system , based on xslt and javascript , provides users with an interface to browse and merge linkbases . xspect supports navigational hypermedia in the form of links inserted on the fly into web pages , as well as guided tours presented as svg . xspect has two implementations : one server-side and one running on the client . both implementation provide the user with an interface for the creation of annotations . the main result of the paper is a critique of xlink . xlink is shown to be a format well suited for navigational hypermedia , but lacking in more advanced constructs . more problematic are the issues regarding large-scale use , such as evaluating validity and credibility of linkbases , and ensuring general support for a format as flexible as xlink .

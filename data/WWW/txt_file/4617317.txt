capturing the essentials of federated systems today , the web is increasingly used as a platform for distributed services , which transcend organizational boundaries to form federated applications . consequently , there is a growing interest in the architectural aspect of web-based systems , i.e. the composition of the overall solution into individual web applications and web services from different parties . the design and evolution of federated systems calls for models that give an overview of the structural as well as trust-specific composition and reflect the technical details of the various accesses . we introduce the webcomposition architecture model ( wam ) as an overall modeling approach tailored to aspects of highly distributed systems with federation as an integral factor .

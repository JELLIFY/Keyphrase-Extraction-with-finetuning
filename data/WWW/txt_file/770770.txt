an evaluation of binary xml encoding optimizations for fast stream based xml processing this paper provides an objective evaluation of the performance impacts of binary xml encodings , using a fast stream-based xquery processor as our representative application . instead of proposing one binary format and comparing it against standard xml parsers , we investigate the individual effects of several binary encoding techniques that are shared by many proposals . our goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the performance impacts of binary xml encodings in order to clarify the ongoing and often contentious debate over their merits , particularly in the domain of high performance xml stream processing .

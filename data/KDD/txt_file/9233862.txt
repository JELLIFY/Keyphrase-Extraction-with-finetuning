reconstructing chemical reaction networks : data mining meets system identification we present an approach to reconstructing chemical reaction networks from time series measurements of the concentrations of the molecules involved . our solution strategy combines techniques from numerical sensitivity analysis and probabilistic graphical models . by modeling a chemical reaction system as a markov network ( undirected graphical model ) , we show how systematically probing for sensitivities between molecular species can identify the topology of the network . given the topology , our approach next uses detailed sensitivity profiles to characterize properties of reactions such as reversibility , enzyme-catalysis , and the precise stoichiometries of the reactants and products . we demonstrate applications to reconstructing key biological systems including the yeast cell cycle . in addition to network reconstruction , our algorithm finds applications in model reduction and model comprehension . we argue that our reconstruction algorithm can serve as an important primitive for data mining in systems biology applications .

buy-it-now or take-a-chance : a simple sequential screening mechanism we present a simple auction mechanism which extends the second-price auction with reserve and is truthful in expectation . this mechanism is particularly effective in private value environments where the distribution of valuations are irregular . bidders can `` buy-it-now '' , or alternatively `` take-a-chance '' where the top d bidders are equally likely to win . the randomized take-a-chance allocation incentivizes high valuation bidders to buy-it-now . we show that for a large class of valuations , this mechanism achieves similar allocations and revenues as myerson 's optimal mechanism , and outperforms the second-price auction with reserve . in addition , we present an evaluation of bid data from microsoft 's adecn platform . we find the valuations are irregular , and counterfactual experiments suggest our bin-tac mechanism would improve revenue by 11 % relative to an optimal second-price mechanism with reserve .

navigationaided retrieval users searching for information in hypermedia environments often perform querying followed by manual navigation . yet , the conventional text\/hypertext retrieval paradigm does not explicity take post-query navigation into account . this paper proposes a new retrieval paradigm , called navigation-aided retrieval ( nar ) , which treats both querying and navigation as first-class activities . in the nar paradigm , querying is seen as a means to identify starting points for navigation , and navigation is guided based on information supplied in the query . nar is a generalization of the conventional probabilistic information retrieval paradigm , which implicitly assumes no navigation takes place . this paper presents a formal model for navigation-aided retrieval , and reports empirical results that point to the real-world applicability of the model . the experiments were performed over a large web corpus provided by trec , using human judgments on a new rating scale developed for navigation-aided retrieval . in the case of ambiguous queries , the new retrieval model identifies good starting points for post-query navigation . for less ambiguous queries that need not be paired with navigation , the output closely matches that of a conventional retrieval system .

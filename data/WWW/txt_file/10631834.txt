probabilistic question recommendation for question answering communities user-interactive question answering ( qa ) communities such as yahoo ! answers are growing in popularity . however , as these qa sites always have thousands of new questions posted daily , it is difficult for users to find the questions that are of interest to them . consequently , this may delay the answering of the new questions . this gives rise to question recommendation techniques that help users locate interesting questions . in this paper , we adopt the probabilistic latent semantic analysis ( plsa ) model for question recommendation and propose a novel metric to evaluate the performance of our approach . the experimental results show our recommendation approach is effective .

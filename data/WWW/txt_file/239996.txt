xquery containment in presence of variable binding dependencies semantic caching is an important technology for improving the response time of future user queries specified over remote servers . this paper deals with the fundamental query containment problem in an xquery-based semantic caching system . to our best knowledge , the impact of subtle differences in xquery semantics caused by different ways of specifying variables on query containment has not yet been studied . we introduce the concept of variable binding dependencies for representing the hierarchical element dependencies preserved by an xquery . we analyze the problem of xquery containment in the presence of such dependencies . we propose a containment mapping technique for nested xquery in presence of variable binding dependencies . the implication of the nested block structure on xquery containment is also considered . we mention the performance gains achieved by a semantic caching system we build based on the proposed technique .

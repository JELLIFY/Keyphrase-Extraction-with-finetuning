lca-based selection for xml document collections in this paper , we address the problem of database selection for xml document collections , that is , given a set of collections and a user query , how to rank the collections based on their goodness to the query . goodness is determined by the relevance of the documents in the collection to the query . we consider keyword queries and support lowest common ancestor ( lca ) semantics for defining query results , where the relevance of each document to a query is determined by properties of the lca of those nodes in the xml document that contain the query keywords . to avoid evaluating queries against each document in a collection , we propose maintaining in a preprocessing phase , information about the lcas of all pairs of keywords in a document and use it to approximate the properties of the lca-based results of a query . to improve storage and processing efficiency , we use appropriate summaries of the lca information based on bloom filters . we address both a boolean and a weighted version of the database selection problem . our experimental results show that our approach incurs low errors in the estimation of the goodness of a collection and provides rankings that are very close to the actual ones .

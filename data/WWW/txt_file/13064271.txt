survivability-oriented self-tuning of web systems running in a highly uncertain and changing environment , web systems can not always provide full set of services with optim Â¬ al quality , especially when the workload is high or failures in subsys-tems occur frequently . it is thus desirable to continuously maintain a high satisfaction level of the system value proposition , hereafter survivability assurance , while relaxing\/sacrificing certain quality\/functional requirements that are not crucial to the survival of the web systems . in this paper , we propose a requirements-driven self-tuning method for survivability assurance of web systems . using a value-based feedback controller plus a requirements-oriented reasoner , our method makes both quality and functional requirements tradeoffs decisions at runtime .

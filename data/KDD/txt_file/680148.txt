mining the space of graph properties existing data mining algorithms on graphs look for nodes satisfying specific properties , such as specific notions of structural similarity or specific measures of link-based importance . while such analyses for predetermined properties can be effective in well-understood domains , sometimes identifying an appropriate property for analysis can be a challenge , and focusing on a single property may neglect other important aspects of the data . in this paper , we develop a foundation for mining the properties themselves . we present a theoretical framework defining the space of graph properties , a variety of mining queries enabled by the framework , techniques to handle the enormous size of the query space , and an experimental system called f-miner that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of property mining .

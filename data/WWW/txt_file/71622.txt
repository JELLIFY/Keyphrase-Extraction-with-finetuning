delivering web service coordination capability to users as web service technology matures there is growing interest in exploiting workflow techniques to coordinate web services . bioinformaticians are a user community who combine web resources to perform in silico experiments . these users are scientists and not information technology experts they require workflow solutions that have a low cost of entry for service users and providers . problems satisfying these requirements with current techniques led to the development of the simple conceptual unified flow language ( scufl ) . scufl is supported by the freefluo enactment engine ( 1 ) , and the taverna editing workbench ( 3 ) . the extensibility of scufl , supported by these tools , means that workflows coordinating web services can be matched to how users view their problems . the taverna workbench exploits the web to keep scufl simple by retrieving detail from uris when required , and by scavenging the web for services . scufl and its tools are not bioinformatics specific . they can be exploited by other communities who require user-driven composition and execution of workflows coordinating web resources .

mining search engine query logs for query recommendation this paper presents a simple and intuitive method for mining search engine query logs to get fast query recommendations on a large scale industrial strength search engine . in order to get a more comprehensive solution , we combine two methods together . on the one hand , we study and model search engine users ' sequential search behavior , and interpret this consecutive search behavior as client-side query refinement , that should form the basis for the search engine 's own query refinement process . on the other hand , we combine this method with a traditional content based similarity method to compensate for the high sparsity of real query log data , and more specifically , the shortness of most query sessions . to evaluate our method , we use one hundred day worth query logs from sina ' search engine to do off-line mining . then we analyze three independent editors evaluations on a query test set . based on their judgement , our method was found to be effective for finding related queries , despite its simplicity . in addition to the subjective editors ' rating , we also perform tests based on actual anonymous user search sessions .

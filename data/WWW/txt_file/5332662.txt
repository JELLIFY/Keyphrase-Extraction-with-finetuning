an investigation of cloning in web applications cloning ( ad hoc reuse by duplication of design or code ) speeds up development , but also hinders future maintenance . cloning also hints at reuse opportunities that , if exploited systematically , might have positive impact on development and maintenance productivity . unstable requirements and tight schedules pose unique challenges for web application engineering that encourage cloning . we are conducting a systematic study of cloning in web applications of different sizes , developed using a range of web technologies , and serving diverse purposes . our initial results show cloning rates up to 63 % in both newly developed and already maintained web applications . expected contribution of this work is two-fold : ( 1 ) to confirm potential benefits of reuse-based methods in addressing clone related problems of web engineering , and ( 2 ) to create a framework of metrics and presentation views to be used in other similar studies .

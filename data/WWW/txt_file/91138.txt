web accessibility : a broader view web accessibility is an important goal . however , most approaches to its attainment are based on unrealistic economic models in which web content developers are required to spend too much for which they receive too little . we believe this situation is due , in part , to the overly narrow definitions given both to those who stand to benefit from enhanced access to the web and what is meant by this enhanced access . in this paper , we take a broader view , discussing a complementary approach that costs developers less and provides greater advantages to a larger community of users . while we have quite specific aims in our technical work , we hope it can also serve as an example of how the technical conversation regarding web accessibility can move beyond the narrow confines of limited adaptations for small populations .

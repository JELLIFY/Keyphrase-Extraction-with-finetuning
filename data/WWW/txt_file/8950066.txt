the semantic webscape : a view of the semantic web it has been a few years since the semantic web was initiated by w3c , but its status has not been quantitatively measured . it is crucial to understand the status at this early stage , for researchers , developers and administrators to gain insight into what will come in this field . the objective of our work is to quantitatively measure and present the status of the semantic web . we conduct a longitudinal study on the semantic web pages to track trends in the use of semantic markup languages . this paper presents early results of this study with two historical data sets from october 2003 and october 2004 . our results show that while it is very early stage of semantic web adoption , its growth outpaces that of the entire web for the period . also , rdf ( resource description framework ) has dominated among semantic markup languages , taking about 98 % of all semantic pages on the web . it has been used in a variety of metadata annotation applications . this study shows that the most popular application is rss ( rdf site summary ) for syndicating news and blogs , which takes more than 60 % of all semantic web pages . it also shows that the use of owl ( web ontology language ) which was recommended by w3c in early 2004 has been increased 900 % for the period .

computer aided detection via asymmetric cascade of sparse hyperplane classifiers this paper describes a novel classification method for computer aided detection ( cad ) that identifies structures of interest from medical images . cad problems are challenging largely due to the following three characteristics . typical cad training data sets are large and extremely unbalanced between positive and negative classes . when searching for descriptive features , researchers often deploy a large set of experimental features , which consequently introduces irrelevant and redundant features . finally , a cad system has to satisfy stringent real-time requirements . this work is distinguished by three key contributions . the first is a cascade classification approach which is able to tackle all the above difficulties in a unified framework by employing an asymmetric cascade of sparse classifiers each trained to achieve high detection sensitivity and satisfactory false positive rates . the second is the incorporation of feature computational costs in a linear program formulation that allows the feature selection process to take into account different evaluation costs of various features . the third is a boosting algorithm derived from column generation optimization to effectively solve the proposed cascade linear programs . we apply the proposed approach to the problem of detecting lung nodules from helical multi-slice ct images . our approach demonstrates superior performance in comparison against support vector machines , linear discriminant analysis and cascade adaboost . especially , the resulting detection system is significantly sped up with our approach .

constructing travel itineraries from tagged geo-temporal breadcrumbs vacation planning is a frequent laborious task which requires skilled interaction with a multitude of resources . this paper develops an end-to-end approach for constructing intra-city travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latent source reflecting geo-temporal breadcrumbs left by millions of tourists . in particular , the popular rich media sharing site , flickr , allows photos to be stamped by the date and time of when they were taken , and be mapped to points of interest ( pois ) by latitude-longitude information as well as semantic metadata ( e.g. , tags ) that describe them . our extensive user study on a `` crowd-sourcing '' marketplace ( amazon mechanical turk ) , indicates that high quality itineraries can be automatically constructed from flickr data , when compared against popular professionally generated bus tours .

dynamic assembly of learning objects this paper describes one solution to the problem of how to select sequence , and link web resources into a coherent , focused organization for instruction that addresses a user 's immediate and focused learning need . a system is described that automatically generates individualized learning paths from a repository of xml web resources . each web resource has an xml learning object metadata ( lom ) description consisting of general , educational , and classification metadata . dynamic assembly of these learning objects is based on the relative match of the learning object content and metadata to the learner 's needs , preferences , context , and constraints . learning objects are connected into coherent paths based on their lom topic classifications and the proximity of these topics in a resource description framework ( rdf ) graph . an instructional sequencing policy specifies how to arrange the objects on the path into a particular learning sequence . the system has been deployed and evaluated within a corporate setting .

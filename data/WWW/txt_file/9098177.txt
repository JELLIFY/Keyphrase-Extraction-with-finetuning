sailer : an effective search engine for unified retrieval of heterogeneous xml and web documents this paper studies the problem of unified ranked retrieval of heterogeneous xml documents and web data . we propose an effective search engine called sailer to adaptively and versatilely answer keyword queries over the heterogenous data . we model the web pages and xml documents as graphs . we propose the concept of pivotal trees to effectively answer keyword queries and present an effective method to identify the top-k pivotal trees with the highest ranks from the graphs . moreover , we propose effective indexes to facilitate the effective unified ranked retrieval . we have conducted an extensive experimental study using real datasets , and the experimental results show that sailer achieves both high search efficiency and accuracy , and outperforms the existing approaches significantly .

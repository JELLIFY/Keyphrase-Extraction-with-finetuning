enabling entity-based aggregators for web 2.0 data selecting and presenting content culled from multiple heterogeneous and physically distributed sources is a challenging task . the exponential growth of the web data in modern times has brought new requirements to such integration systems . data is not any more produced by content providers alone , but also from regular users through the highly popular web 2.0 social and semantic web applications . the plethora of the available web content increased its demand by regular users who could not any more wait the development of advanced integration tools . they wanted to be able to build in a short time their own specialized integration applications . aggregators came to the risk of these users . they allowed them not only to combine distributed content , but also to process it in ways that generate new services available for further consumption . to cope with the heterogeneous data , the linked data initiative aims at the creation and exploitation of correspondences across data values . in this work , although we share the linked data community vision , we advocate that for the modern web , linking at the data value level is not enough . aggregators should base their integration tasks on the concept of an entity , i.e. , identifying whether different pieces of information correspond to the same real world entity , such as an event or a person . we describe our theory , system , and experimental results that illustrate the approach 's effectiveness .

estimating the cardinality of rdf graph patterns most rdf query languages allow for graph structure search through a conjunction of triples which is typically processed using join operations . a key factor in optimizing joins is determining the join order which depends on the expected cardinality of intermediate results . this work proposes a pattern-based summarization framework for estimating the cardinality of rdf graph patterns . we present experiments on real world and synthetic datasets which confirm the feasibility of our approach .

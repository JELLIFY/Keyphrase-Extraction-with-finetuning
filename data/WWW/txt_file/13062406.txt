milgram-routing in social networks we demonstrate how a recent model of social networks ( `` affiliation networks '' , ( 21 ) ) offers powerful cues in local routing within social networks , a theme made famous by sociologist milgram 's `` six degrees of separation '' experiments . this model posits the existence of an `` interest space '' that underlies a social network ; we prove that in networks produced by this model , not only do short paths exist among all pairs of nodes but natural local routing algorithms can discover them effectively . specifically , we show that local routing can discover paths of length o ( log2 n ) to targets chosen uniformly at random , and paths of length o ( 1 ) to targets chosen with probability proportional to their degrees . experiments on the co-authorship graph derived from dblp data confirm our theoretical results , and shed light into the power of one step of lookahead in routing algorithms for social networks .

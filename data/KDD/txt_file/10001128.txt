entity discovery and assignment for opinion mining applications opinion mining became an important topic of study in recent years due to its wide range of applications . there are also many companies offering opinion mining services . one problem that has not been studied so far is the assignment of entities that have been talked about in each sentence . let us use forum discussions about products as an example to make the problem concrete . in a typical discussion post , the author may give opinions on multiple products and also compare them . the issue is how to detect what products have been talked about in each sentence . if the sentence contains the product names , they need to be identified . we call this problem entity discovery . if the product names are not explicitly mentioned in the sentence but are implied due to the use of pronouns and language conventions , we need to infer the products . we call this problem entity assignment . these problems are important because without knowing what products each sentence talks about the opinion mined from the sentence is of little use . in this paper , we study these problems and propose two effective methods to solve the problems . entity discovery is based on pattern discovery and entity assignment is based on mining of comparative sentences . experimental results using a large number of forum posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique . our system has also been successfully tested in a commercial setting .

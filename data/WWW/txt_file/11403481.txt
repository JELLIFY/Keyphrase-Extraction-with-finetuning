antourage : mining distance-constrained trips from flickr we study how to automatically extract tourist trips from large volumes of geo-tagged photographs . working with more than 8 million of these photographs that are publicly available via photo - sharing communities such as flickr and panoramio , our goal is to satisfy the needs of a tourist who specifies a starting location ( typically a hotel ) together with a bounded travel distance and demands a tour that visits the popular sites along the way . our system , named antourage , solves this intractable problem using a novel adaptation of the max-min ant system ( mmas ) meta-heuristic . experiments using gps metadata crawled from flickr show that antourage can generate high-quality tours .

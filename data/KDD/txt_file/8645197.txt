distributed multivariate regression based on influential observations large-scale data sets are sometimes logically and physically distributed in separate databases . the issues of mining these data sets are not just their sizes , but also the distributed nature . the complication is that communicating all the data to a central database would be too slow . to reduce communication costs , one could compress the data during transmission . another method is random sampling . we propose an approach for distributed multivariate regression based on sampling and discuss its relationship with the compression method . the central idea is motivated by the observation that , although communication is limited , each individual site can still scan and process all the data it holds . thus it is possible for the site to communicate only influential samples without seeing data in other sites . we exploit this observation and derive a method that provides tradeoff between communication cost and accuracy . experimental results show that it is better than the compression method and random sampling .

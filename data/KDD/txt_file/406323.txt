sewep : using site semantics and a taxonomy to enhance the web personalization process web personalization is the process of customizing a web site to the needs of each specific user or set of users , taking advantage of the knowledge acquired through the analysis of the user 's navigational behavior . integrating usage data with content , structure or user profile data enhances the results of the personalization process . in this paper , we present sewep , a system that makes use of both the usage logs and the semantics of a web site 's content in order to personalize it . web content is semantically annotated using a conceptual hierarchy ( taxonomy ) . we introduce c-logs , an extended form of web usage logs that encapsulates knowledge derived from the link semantics . c-logs are used as input to the web usage mining process , resulting in a broader yet semantically focused set of recommendations .

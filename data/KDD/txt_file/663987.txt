discovery of climate indices using clustering to analyze the effect of the oceans and atmosphere on land climate , earth scientists have developed climate indices , which are time series that summarize the behavior of selected regions of the earth 's oceans and atmosphere . in the past , earth scientists have used observation and , more recently , eigenvalue analysis techniques , such as principal components analysis ( pca ) and singular value decomposition ( svd ) , to discover climate indices . however , eigenvalue techniques are only useful for finding a few of the strongest signals . furthermore , they impose a condition that all discovered signals must be orthogonal to each other , making it difficult to attach a physical interpretation to them . this paper presents an alternative clustering-based methodology for the discovery of climate indices that overcomes these limitiations and is based on clusters that represent regions with relatively homogeneous behavior . the centroids of these clusters are time series that summarize the behavior of the ocean or atmosphere in those regions . some of these centroids correspond to known climate indices and provide a validation of our methodology ; other centroids are variants of known indices that may provide better predictive power for some land areas ; and still other indices may represent potentially new earth science phenomena . finally , we show that cluster based indices generally outperform svd derived indices , both in terms of area weighted correlation and direct correlation with the known indices .

growing a tree in the forest : constructing folksonomies by integrating structured metadata many social web sites allow users to annotate the content with descriptive metadata , such as tags , and more recently to organize content hierarchically . these types of structured metadata provide valuable evidence for learning how a community organizes knowledge . for instance , we can aggregate many personal hierarchies into a common taxonomy , also known as a folksonomy , that will aid users in visualizing and browsing social content , and also to help them in organizing their own content . however , learning from social metadata presents several challenges , since it is sparse , shallow , ambiguous , noisy , and inconsistent . we describe an approach to folksonomy learning based on relational clustering , which exploits structured metadata contained in personal hierarchies . our approach clusters similar hierarchies using their structure and tag statistics , then incrementally weaves them into a deeper , bushier tree . we study folksonomy learning using social metadata extracted from the photo-sharing site flickr , and demonstrate that the proposed approach addresses the challenges . moreover , comparing to previous work , the approach produces larger , more accurate folksonomies , and in addition , scales better .

tag-oriented document summarization social annotations on a web document are highly generalized description of topics contained in that page . their tagged frequency indicates the user attentions with various degrees . this makes annotations a good resource for summarizing multiple topics in a web page . in this paper , we present a tag-oriented web document summarization approach by using both document content and the tags annotated on that document . to improve summarization performance , a new tag ranking algorithm named eigentag is proposed in this paper to reduce noise in tags . meanwhile , association mining technique is employed to expand tag set to tackle the sparsity problem . experimental results show our tag-oriented summarization has a significant improvement over those not using tags .

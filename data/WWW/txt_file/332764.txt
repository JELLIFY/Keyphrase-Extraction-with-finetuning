static approximation of dynamically generated web pages server-side programming is one of the key technologies that support today 's www environment . it makes it possible to generate web pages dynamically according to a user 's request and to customize pages for each user . however , the flexibility obtained by server-side programming makes it much harder to guarantee validity and security of dynamically generated pages . to check statically the properties of web pages generated dynamically by a server-side program , we develop a static program analysis that approximates the string output of a program with a context-free grammar . the approximation obtained by the analyzer can be used to check various properties of a server-side program and the pages it generates . to demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis , we have implemented a string analyzer for the server-side scripting language php . the analyzer is successfully applied to publicly available php programs to detect cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and to validate pages they generate dynamically .

using proportional transportation similarity with learned element semantics for xml document clustering this paper proposes a novel approach to measuring xml document similarity by taking into account the semantics between xml elements . the motivation of the proposed approach is to overcome the problems of `` under-contributionö and `` over-contributionö existing in previous work . the element semantics are learned in an unsupervised way and the proportional transportation similarity is proposed to evaluate xml document similarity by modeling the similarity calculation as a transportation problem . experiments of clustering are performed on three acm sigmod data sets and results show the favorable performance of the proposed approach .

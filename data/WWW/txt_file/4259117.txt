quality driven web services composition the process-driven composition of web services is emerging as a promising approach to integrate business applications within and across organizational boundaries . in this approach , individual web services are federated into composite web services whose business logic is expressed as a process model . the tasks of this process model are essentially invocations to functionalities offered by the underlying component services . usually , several component services are able to execute a given task , although with different levels of pricing and quality . in this paper , we advocate that the selection of component services should be carried out during the execution of a composite service , rather than at design-time . in addition , this selection should consider multiple criteria ( e.g. , price , duration , reliability ) , and it should take into account global constraints and preferences set by the user ( e.g. , budget constraints ) . accordingly , the paper proposes a global planning approach to optimally select component services during the execution of a composite service . service selection is formulated as an optimization problem which can be solved using efficient linear programming methods . experimental results show that this global planning approach outperforms approaches in which the component services are selected individually for each task in a composite service .

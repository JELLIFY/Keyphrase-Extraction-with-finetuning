combining classifiers to identify online databases we address the problem of identifying the domain of onlinedatabases . more precisely , given a set f of web forms automaticallygathered by a focused crawler and an online databasedomain d , our goal is to select from f only the formsthat are entry points to databases in d. having a set ofwebforms that serve as entry points to similar online databasesis a requirement for many applications and techniques thataim to extract and integrate hidden-web information , suchas meta-searchers , online database directories , hidden-webcrawlers , and form-schema matching and merging . we propose a new strategy that automatically and accuratelyclassifies online databases based on features that canbe easily extracted from web forms . by judiciously partitioningthe space of form features , this strategy allows theuse of simpler classifiers that can be constructed using learningtechniques that are better suited for the features of eachpartition . experiments using real web data in a representativeset of domains show that the use of different classifiersleads to high accuracy , precision and recall . this indicatesthat our modular classifier composition provides an effectiveand scalable solution for classifying online databases .

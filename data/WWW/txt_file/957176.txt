analysis of multimedia workloads with implications for internet streaming in this paper , we study the media workload collected from a large number of commercial web sites hosted by a major isp and that collected from a large group of home users connected to the internet via a well-known cable company . some of our key findings are : ( 1 ) surprisingly , the majority of media contents are still delivered via downloading from web servers . ( 2 ) a substantial percentage of media downloading connections are aborted before completion due to the long waiting time . ( 3 ) a hybrid approach , pseudo streaming , is used by clients to imitate real streaming . ( 4 ) the mismatch between the downloading rate and the client playback speed in pseudo streaming is common , which either causes frequent playback delays to the clients , or unnecessary traffic to the internet . ( 5 ) compared with streaming , downloading and pseudo streaming are neither bandwidth efficient nor performance effective . to address this problem , we propose the design of autostream , an innovative system that can provide additional previewing and streaming services automatically for media objects hosted on standard web sites in server farms at the client 's will .

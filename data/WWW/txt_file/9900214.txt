personalized web exploration with task models personalized web search has emerged as one of the hottest topics for both the web industry and academic researchers . however , the majority of studies on personalized search focused on a rather simple type of search , which leaves an important research topic - the personalization in exploratory searches - as an under-studied area . in this paper , we present a study of personalization in task-based information exploration using a system called tasksieve . tasksieve is a web search system that utilizes a relevance feedback based profile , called a `` task model '' , for personalization . its innovations include flexible and user controlled integration of queries and task models , task-infused text snippet generation , and on-screen visualization of task models . through an empirical study using human subjects conducting task-based exploration searches , we demonstrate that tasksieve pushes significantly more relevant documents to the top of search result lists as compared to a traditional search system . tasksieve helps users select significantly more accurate information for their tasks , allows the users to do so with higher productivity , and is viewed more favorably by subjects under several usability related characteristics .

an enhanced model for searching in semantic portals semantic portal is the next generation of web portals that are powered by semantic web technologies for improved information sharing and exchange for a community of users . current methods of searching in semantic portals are limited to keyword-based search using information retrieval ( ir ) techniques , ontology-based formal query and reasoning , or a simple combination of the two . in this paper , we propose an enhanced model that tightly integrates ir with formal query and reasoning to fully utilize both textual and semantic information for searching in semantic portals . the model extends the search capabilities of existing methods and can answer more complex search requests . the ideas in a fuzzy description logic ( dl ) ir model and a formal dl query method are employed and combined in our model . based on the model , a semantic search service is implemented and evaluated . the evaluation shows very large improvements over existing methods .

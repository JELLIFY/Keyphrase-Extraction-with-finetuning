experiments with random projections for machine learning dimensionality reduction via random projections has attracted considerable attention in recent years . the approach has interesting theoretical underpinnings and offers computational advantages . in this paper we report a number of experiments to evaluate random projections in the context of inductive supervised learning . in particular , we compare random projections and pca on a number of different datasets and using different machine learning methods . while we find that the random projection approach predictively underperforms pca , its computational advantages may make it attractive for certain applications .

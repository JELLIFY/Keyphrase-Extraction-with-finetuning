finding low-entropy sets and trees from binary data the discovery of subsets with special properties from binary data hasbeen one of the key themes in pattern discovery . pattern classes suchas frequent itemsets stress the co-occurrence of the value 1 in the data . while this choice makes sense in the context of sparse binary data , it disregards potentially interesting subsets of attributes that have some other type of dependency structure . we consider the problem of finding all subsets of attributes that have low complexity . the complexity is measured by either the entropy of the projection of the data on the subset , or the entropy of the data for the subset when modeled using a bayesian tree , with downward or upward pointing edges . we show that the entropy measure on sets has a monotonicity property , and thus a levelwise approach can find all low-entropy itemsets . we also show that the tree-based measures are bounded above by the entropy of the corresponding itemset , allowing similar algorithms to be used for finding low-entropy trees . we describe algorithms for finding all subsets satisfying an entropy condition . we give an extensive empirical evaluation of the performance of the methods both on synthetic and on real data . we also discuss the search for high-entropy subsets and the computation of the vapnik-chervonenkis dimension of the data .

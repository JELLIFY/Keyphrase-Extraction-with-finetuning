optimizing web search using social annotations this paper explores the use of social annotations to improve websearch . nowadays , many services , e.g. del. icio . us , have been developed for web users to organize and share their favorite webpages on line by using social annotations . we observe that the social annotations can benefit web search in two aspects : 1 ) the annotations are usually good summaries of corresponding webpages ; 2 ) the count of annotations indicates the popularity of webpages . two novel algorithms are proposed to incorporate the above information into page ranking : 1 ) socialsimrank ( ssr ) calculates the similarity between social annotations and webqueries ; 2 ) socialpagerank ( spr ) captures the popularity of webpages . preliminary experimental results show that ssr can find the latent semantic association between queries and annotations , while spr successfully measures the quality ( popularity ) of a webpage from the web users ' perspective . we further evaluate the proposed methods empirically with 50 manually constructed queries and 3000 auto-generated queries on a dataset crawledfrom delicious . experiments show that both ssr and sprbenefit web search significantly .

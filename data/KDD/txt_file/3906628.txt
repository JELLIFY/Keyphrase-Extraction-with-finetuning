deriving quantitative models for correlation clusters correlation clustering aims at grouping the data set into correlation clusters such that the objects in the same cluster exhibit a certain density and are all associated to a common arbitrarily oriented hyperplane of arbitrary dimensionality . several algorithms for this task have been proposed recently . however , all algorithms only compute the partitioning of the data into clusters . this is only a first step in the pipeline of advanced data analysis and system modelling . the second ( post-clustering ) step of deriving a quantitative model for each correlation cluster has not been addressed so far . in this paper , we describe an original approach to handle this second step . we introduce a general method that can extract quantitative information on the linear dependencies within a correlation clustering . our concepts are independent of the clustering model and can thus be applied as a post-processing step to any correlation clustering algorithm . furthermore , we show how these quantitative models can be used to predict the probability distribution that an object is created by these models . our broad experimental evaluation demonstrates the beneficial impact of our method on several applications of significant practical importance .

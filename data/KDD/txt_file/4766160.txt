the minimum consistent subset cover problem and its applications in data mining in this paper , we introduce and study the minimum consistent subset cover ( mcsc ) problem . given a finite ground set x and a constraint t , find the minimum number of consistent subsets that cover x , where a subset of x is consistent if it satisfies t. the mcsc problem generalizes the traditional set covering problem and has minimum clique partition , a dual problem of graph coloring , as an instance . many practical data mining problems in the areas of rule learning , clustering , and frequent pattern mining can be formulated as mcsc instances . in particular , we discuss the minimum rule set problem that minimizes model complexity of decision rules as well as some converse k-clustering problems that minimize the number of clusters satisfying certain distance constraints . we also show how the mcsc problem can find applications in frequent pattern summarization . for any of these mcsc formulations , our proposed novel graph-based generic algorithm cag can be directly applicable . cag starts by constructing a maximal optimal partial solution , then performs an example-driven specific-to-general search on a dynamically maintained bipartite assignment graph to simultaneously learn a set of consistent subsets with small cardinality covering the ground set . our experiments on benchmark datasets show that cag achieves good results compared to existing popular heuristics .

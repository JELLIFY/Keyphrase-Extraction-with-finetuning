detecting near-duplicates for web crawling near-duplicate web documents are abundant . two such documents differ from each other in a very small portion that displays advertisements , for example . such differences are irrelevant for web search . so the quality of a web crawler increases if it can assess whether a newly crawled web page is a near-duplicate of a previously crawled web page or not . in the course of developing a near-duplicate detection system for a multi-billion page repository , we make two research contributions . first , we demonstrate that charikar 's fingerprinting technique is appropriate for this goal . second , we present an algorithmic technique for identifying existing f-bit fingerprints that differ from a given fingerprint in at most k bit-positions , for small k. our technique is useful for both online queries ( single fingerprints ) and all batch queries ( multiple fingerprints ) . experimental evaluation over real data confirms the practicality of our design .

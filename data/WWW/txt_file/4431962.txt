integrating value-based requirement engineering models to webml using vip business modeling framework requirement engineering ( re ) is emerging as an increasingly important discipline for supporting web application development , as these are designed to satisfy diverse stakeholder needs , additional functional , information , multimedia and usability requirements as compared to traditional software applications . moreover , when considering innovative e-commerce applications , value-based re is an extremely relevant methodology which exploits the concept of economic value during the re activity . in contrast , most of the methodologies proposed for the development of web applications , primarily focus on the system design , and paying less attention to the re , and specifically to value-based re . focusing this aspect , the paper presents integration of value-based re models to webml models using our recently proposed vip business modeling framework ( 1 ) . we also analyze the framework 's potential in linking other modeling approaches , and argue about its significant integration potential with various e-r\/oo-based , process aware web modeling approaches .

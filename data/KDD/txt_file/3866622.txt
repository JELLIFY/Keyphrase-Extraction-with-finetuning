supervised probabilistic principal component analysis principal component analysis ( pca ) has been extensively applied in data mining , pattern recognition and information retrieval for unsupervised dimensionality reduction . when labels of data are available , e.g. , in a classification or regression task , pca is however not able to use this information . the problem is more interesting if only part of the input data are labeled , i.e. , in a semi-supervised setting . in this paper we propose a supervised pca model called sppca and a semi-supervised pca model called s2ppca , both of which are extensions of a probabilistic pca model . the proposed models are able to incorporate the label information into the projection phase , and can naturally handle multiple outputs ( i.e. , in multi-task learning problems ) . we derive an efficient em learning algorithm for both models , and also provide theoretical justifications of the model behaviors . sppca and s2ppca are compared with other supervised projection methods on various learning tasks , and show not only promising performance but also good scalability .

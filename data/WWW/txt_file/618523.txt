dynamic maintenance of web indexes using landmarks recent work on incremental crawling has enabled the indexed document collection of a search engine to be more synchronized with the changing world wide web . however , this synchronized collection is not immediately searchable , because the keyword index is rebuilt from scratch less frequently than the collection can be refreshed . an inverted index is usually used to index documents crawled from the web . complete index rebuild at high frequency is expensive . previous work on incremental inverted index updates have been restricted to adding and removing documents . updating the inverted index for previously indexed documents that have changed has not been addressed . in this paper , we propose an efficient method to update the inverted index for previously indexed documents whose contents have changed . our method uses the idea of landmarks together with the diff algorithm to significantly reduce the number of postings in the inverted index that need to be updated . our experiments verify that our landmark-diff method results in significant savings in the number of update operations on the inverted index .

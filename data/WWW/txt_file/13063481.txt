efficient k-nearest neighbor graph construction for generic similarity measures k-nearest neighbor graph ( k-nng ) construction is an important operation with many web related applications , including collaborative filtering , similarity search , and many others in data mining and machine learning . existing methods for k-nng construction either do not scale , or are specific to certain similarity measures . we present nn-descent , a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximate k-nng construction with arbitrary similarity measures . our method is based on local search , has minimal space overhead and does not rely on any shared global index . hence , it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network . we have shown with a variety of datasets and similarity measures that the proposed method typically converges to above 90 % recall with each point comparing only to several percent of the whole dataset on average .

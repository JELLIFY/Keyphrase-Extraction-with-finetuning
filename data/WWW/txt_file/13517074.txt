instance-based probabilistic reasoning in the semantic web most of the approaches for dealing with uncertainty in the semantic web rely on the principle that this uncertainty is already asserted . in this paper , we propose a new approach to learn and reason about uncertainty in the semantic web . using instance data , we learn the uncertainty of an owl ontology , and use that information to perform probabilistic reasoning on it . for this purpose , we use markov logic , a new representation formalism that combines logic with probabilistic graphical models .

towards lightweight and efficient ddos attacks detection for web server in this poster , based on our previous work in building a lightweight ddos ( distributed denial-of-services ) attacks detection mechanism for web server using tcm-knn ( transductive confidence machines for k-nearest neighbors ) and genetic algorithm based instance selection methods , we further propose a more efficient and effective instance selection method , named e-fcm ( extend fuzzy c-means ) . by using this method , we can obtain much cheaper training time for tcm-knn while ensuring high detection performance . therefore , the optimized mechanism is more suitable for lightweight ddos attacks detection in real network environment .

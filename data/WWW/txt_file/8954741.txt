backrank : an alternative for pagerank ? this paper proposes to extend a previous work , the effect of the back button in a random walk : application for pagerank ( 5 ) . we introduce an enhanced version of the pagerank algorithm using a realistic model for the back button , thus improving the random surfer model . we show that in the special case where the history is bound to an unique page ( you can not use the back button twice in a row ) , we can produce an algorithm that does not need much more resources than a standard pagerank . this algorithm , backrank , can converge up to 30 % faster than a standard pagerank and suppress most of the drawbacks induced by the existence of pages without links .

correlation search in graph databases correlation mining has gained great success in many application domains for its ability to capture the underlying dependency between objects . however , the research of correlation mining from graph databases is still lacking despite the fact that graph data , especially in various scientific domains , proliferate in recent years . in this paper , we propose a new problem of correlation mining from graph databases , called correlated graph search ( cgs ) . cgs adopts pearson 's correlation coefficient as a correlation measure to take into consideration the occurrence distributions of graphs . however , the problem poses significant challenges , since every subgraph of a graph in the database is a candidate but the number of subgraphs is exponential . we derive two necessary conditions which set bounds on the occurrence probability of a candidate in the database . with this result , we design an efficient algorithm that operates on a much smaller projected database and thus we are able to obtain a significantly smaller set of candidates . to further improve the efficiency , we develop three heuristic rules and apply them on the candidate set to further reduce the search space . our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on candidate reduction . the results also justify the efficiency of our algorithm in mining correlations from large real and synthetic datasets .

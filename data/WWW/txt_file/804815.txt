web data integration using approximate string join web data integration is an important preprocessing step for web mining . it is highly likely that several records on the web whose textual representations differ may represent the same real world entity . these records are called approximate duplicates . data integration seeks to identify such approximate duplicates and merge them into integrated records . many existing data integration algorithms make use of approximate string join , which seeks to ( approximately ) find all pairs of strings whose distances are less than a certain threshold . in this paper , we propose a new mapping method to detect pairs of strings with similarity above a certain threshold . in our method , each string is first mapped to a point in a high dimensional grid space , then pairs of points whose distances are 1 are identified . we implement it using oracle sql and pl\/sql . finally , we evaluate this method using real data sets . experimental results suggest that our method is both accurate and efficient .

harnessing the wisdom of crowds : video event detection based on synchronous comments with the recent explosive growth of the number of videos on the web , it becomes more important to facilitate users ' demand for locating their preferred event clips in the lengthy and voluminous programs . although there has been a great deal of study on generic event detection in recent years , the performance of existing approaches is still far from satisfactory . in this paper , we propose an integrated framework for general event detection . the key idea is that we utilize the synchronous comments to segment the video into clips with semantic text analysis , while taking into account the relationship between the users who write the comments . by borrowing the power of `` the wisdom of crowds '' , we experimentally demonstrate that our approach can effectively detect video events .

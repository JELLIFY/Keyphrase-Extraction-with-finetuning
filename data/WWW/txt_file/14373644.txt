max algorithms in crowdsourcing environments our work investigates the problem of retrieving the maximum item from a set in crowdsourcing environments . we first develop parameterized families of max algorithms , that take as input a set of items and output an item from the set that is believed to be the maximum . such max algorithms could , for instance , select the best facebook profile that matches a given person or the best photo that describes a given restaurant . then , we propose strategies that select appropriate max algorithm parameters . our framework supports various human error and cost models and we consider many of them for our experiments . we evaluate under many metrics , both analytically and via simulations , the tradeoff between three quantities : ( 1 ) quality , ( 2 ) monetary cost , and ( 3 ) execution time . also , we provide insights on the effectiveness of the strategies in selecting appropriate max algorithm parameters and guidelines for choosing max algorithms and strategies for each application .

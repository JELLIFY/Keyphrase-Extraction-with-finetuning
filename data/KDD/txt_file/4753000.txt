scalable look-ahead linear regression trees most decision tree algorithms base their splitting decisions on a piecewise constant model . often these splitting algorithms are extrapolated to trees with non-constant models at the leaf nodes . the motivation behind look-ahead linear regression trees ( llrt ) is that out of all the methods proposed to date , there has been no scalable approach to exhaustively evaluate all possible models in the leaf nodes in order to obtain an optimal split . using several optimizations , llrt is able to generate and evaluate thousands of linear regression models per second . this allows for a near-exhaustive evaluation of all possible splits in a node , based on the quality of fit of linear regression models in the resulting branches . we decompose the calculation of the residual sum of squares in such a way that a large part of it is pre-computed . the resulting method is highly scalable . we observe it to obtain high predictive accuracy for problems with strong mutual dependencies between attributes . we report on experiments with two simulated and seven real data sets .

mining advisor-advisee relationships from research publication networks information network contains abundant knowledge about relationships among people or entities . unfortunately , such kind of knowledge is often hidden in a network where different kinds of relationships are not explicitly categorized . for example , in a research publication network , the advisor-advisee relationships among researchers are hidden in the coauthor network . discovery of those relationships can benefit many interesting applications such as expert finding and research community analysis . in this paper , we take a computer science bibliographic network as an example , to analyze the roles of authors and to discover the likely advisor-advisee relationships . in particular , we propose a time-constrained probabilistic factor graph model ( tpfg ) , which takes a research publication network as input and models the advisor-advisee relationship mining problem using a jointly likelihood objective function . we further design an efficient learning algorithm to optimize the objective function . based on that our model suggests and ranks probable advisors for every author . experimental results show that the proposed approach infer advisor-advisee relationships efficiently and achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy ( 80-90 % ) . we also apply the discovered advisor-advisee relationships to bole search , a specific expert finding task and empirical study shows that the search performance can be effectively improved ( +4.09 % by ndcg@5 ) .

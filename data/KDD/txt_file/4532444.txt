using randomized response techniques for privacy-preserving data mining privacy is an important issue in data mining and knowledge discovery . in this paper , we propose to use the randomized response techniques to conduct the data mining computation . specially , we present a method to build decision tree classifiers from the disguised data . we conduct experiments to compare the accuracy of our decision tree with the one built from the original undisguised data . our results show that although the data are disguised , our method can still achieve fairly high accuracy . we also show how the parameter used in the randomized response techniques affects the accuracy of the results .

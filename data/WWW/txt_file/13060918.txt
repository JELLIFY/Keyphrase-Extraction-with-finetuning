embedding mindmap as a service for user-driven composition of web applications the world wide web is evolving towards a very large distributed platform allowing ubiquitous access to a wide range of web applications with minimal delay and no installation required . such web applications range from having users undertake simple tasks , such as filling a form , to more complex tasks including collaborative work , project management , and more generally , creating , consulting , annotating , and sharing web content . however , users are lacking a simple but yet powerful mechanism to compose web applications , similarly to what desktop environments allowed for decades using the file explorer paradigm and the desktop metaphor . attempts have been made to adapt the desktop metaphor to the web environment giving birth to webtops ( web desktops ) . it essentially consisted of embedding a desktop environment in a web browser and provide access to various web applications within the same user interface . however , those attempts did not take into consideration to the radical differences between web and desktop environments and applications . in this work , we introduce a new approach for web application composition based on the mindmap metaphor . it allows browsing artifacts ( web resources ) and enabling user-driven composition of their associated web applications . essentially , a mindmap is a graph of widgets representing artifacts created or used by web applications and allow to list and launch all possible web applications associated to each artifact . a tool has been developed to experiment the new metaphor and is provided as a service to be embedded in web applications via a web browser 's plug-in . we demonstrate in this paper three case studies regarding the dblp web site , wikipedia and google picasa web applications .

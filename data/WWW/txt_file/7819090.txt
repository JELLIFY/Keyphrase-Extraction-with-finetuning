flickr tag recommendation based on collective knowledge online photo services such as flickr and zooomr allow users to share their photos with family , friends , and the online community at large . an important facet of these services is that users manually annotate their photos using so called tags , which describe the contents of the photo or provide additional contextual and semantical information . in this paper we investigate how we can assist users in the tagging phase . the contribution of our research is twofold . we analyze a representative snapshot of flickr and present the results by means of a tag characterisation focussing on how users tags photos and what information is contained in the tagging . based on this analysis , we present and evaluate tag recommendation strategies to support the user in the photo annotation task by recommending a set of tags that can be added to the photo . the results of the empirical evaluation show that we can effectively recommend relevant tags for a variety of photos with different levels of exhaustiveness of original tagging .

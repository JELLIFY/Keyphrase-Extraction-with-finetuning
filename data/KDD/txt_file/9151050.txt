mining adaptively frequent closed unlabeled rooted trees in data streams closed patterns are powerful representatives of frequent patterns , since they eliminate redundant information . we propose a new approach for mining closed unlabeled rooted trees adaptively from data streams that change over time . our approach is based on an efficient representation of trees and a low complexity notion of relaxed closed trees , and leads to an on-line strategy and an adaptive sliding window technique for dealing with changes over time . more precisely , we first present a general methodology to identify closed patterns in a data stream , using galois lattice theory . using this methodology , we then develop three closed tree mining algorithms : an incremental one inctreenat , a sliding-window based one , wintreenat , and finally one that mines closed trees adaptively from data streams , adatreenat . to the best of our knowledge this is the first work on mining frequent closed trees in streaming data varying with time . we give a first experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms .

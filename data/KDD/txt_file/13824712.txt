clustering with relative constraints recent studies have suggested using relative distance comparisons as constraints to represent domain knowledge . a natural extension to relative comparisons is the combination of two comparisons defined on the same set of three instances . constraints in this form , termed relative constraints , provide a unified knowledge representation for both partitional and hierarchical clusterings . but many key properties of relative constraints remain unknown . in this paper , we answer the following important questions that enable the broader application of relative constraints in general clustering problems : '' feasibility : does there exist a clustering that satisfies a given set of relative constraints ? ( consistency of constraints ) `` completeness : given a set of consistent relative constraints , how can one derive a complete clustering without running into dead-ends ? '' informativeness : how can one extract the most informative relative constraints from given knowledge sources ? we show that any hierarchical domain knowledge can be easily represented by relative constraints . we further present a hierarchical algorithm that finds a clustering satisfying all given constraints in polynomial time . experiments showed that our algorithm achieves significantly higher accuracy than the existing metric learning approach based on relative comparisons .

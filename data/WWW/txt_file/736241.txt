g-topss : fast filtering of graph-based metadata rdf is increasingly being used to represent metadata . rdf site summary ( rss ) is an application of rdf on the web that has considerably grown in popularity . however , the way rss systems operate today does not scale well . in this paper we introduce g-topss , a scalable publish\/subscribe system for selective information dissemination . g-topss is particularly well suited for applications that deal with large-volume content distribution from diverse sources . rss is an instance of the content distribution problem . g-topss allows use of ontology as a way to provide additional information about the data . furthermore , in this paper we show how g-topss can support rdfs class taxonomies . we have implemented and experimentally evaluated g-topss and we provide results in the paper demonstrating its scalability compared to alternatives .

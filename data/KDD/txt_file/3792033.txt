yale : rapid prototyping for complex data mining tasks kdd is a complex and demanding task . while a large number of methods has been established for numerous problems , many challenges remain to be solved . new tasks emerge requiring the development of new methods or processing schemes . like in software development , the development of such solutions demands for careful analysis , specification , implementation , and testing . rapid prototyping is an approach which allows crucial design decisions as early as possible . a rapid prototyping system should support maximal re-use and innovative combinations of existing methods , as well as simple and quick integration of new ones . this paper describes yale , a free open-source environment forkdd and machine learning . yale provides a rich variety of methods whichallows rapid prototyping for new applications and makes costlyre-implementations unnecessary . additionally , yale offers extensive functionality for process evaluation and optimization which is a crucial property for any kdd rapid prototyping tool . following the paradigm of visual programming eases the design of processing schemes . while the graphical user interface supports interactive design , the underlying xml representation enables automated applications after the prototyping phase . after a discussion of the key concepts of yale , we illustrate the advantages of rapid prototyping for kdd on case studies ranging from data pre-processing to result visualization . these case studies cover tasks like feature engineering , text mining , data stream mining and tracking drifting concepts , ensemble methods and distributed data mining . this variety of applications is also reflected in a broad user base , we counted more than 40,000 downloads during the last twelve months .

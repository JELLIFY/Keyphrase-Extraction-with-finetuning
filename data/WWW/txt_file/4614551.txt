using symbolic objects to cluster web documents web clustering is useful for several activities in the www , from automatically building web directories to improve retrieval performance . nevertheless , due to the huge size of the web , a linear mechanism must be employed to cluster web documents . the k-means is one classic algorithm used in this problem . we present a variant of the vector model to be used with the k-means algorithm . our representation uses symbolic objects for clustering web documents . some experiments were done with positive results and future work is optimistic .

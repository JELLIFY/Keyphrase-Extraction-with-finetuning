semantic search activities such as web services and the semantic web are working to create a web of distributed machine understandable data . in this paper we present an application called ` semantic search ' which is built on these supporting technologies and is designed to improve traditional web searching . we provide an overview of tap , the application framework upon which the semantic search is built . we describe two implemented semantic search systems which , based on the denotation of the search query , augment traditional search results with relevant data aggregated from distributed sources . we also discuss some general issues related to searching and the semantic web and outline how an understanding of the semantics of the search terms can be used to provide better results .

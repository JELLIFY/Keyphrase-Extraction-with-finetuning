geographic locations of web servers the cctld ( country code top level domain ) in a url does not necessarily point to the geographic location of the server concerned . the authors have surveyed sample servers belonging to 60 cctlds in africa , with regard to the number of hops required to reach the target site from japan , the response time , and the nic registration information of each domain . the survey has revealed the geographical distribution of server sites as well as their connection environments . it has been found that the percentage of offshore ( out of home country ) servers is as high as 80 % and more than half of these are located in europe . offshore servers not only provide little benefit to the people of the country to which each cctld rightly belongs but their existence also heightens the risk of a country being unable to control them with its own policies and regulations . offshore servers constitute a significant aspect of the digital divide problem .

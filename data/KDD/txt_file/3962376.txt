integration of profile hidden markov model output into association rule mining scientific models typically depend on parameters . preserving the parameter dependence of models in the pattern mining context opens up several applications . within association rule mining ( arm ) , the choice of parameters can be studied with more flexibly then in traditional model building . studying support , confidence , and other rule metrics as a function of model parameters allows conclusions on assumptions underlying the models . we present efficient techniques to handle multiple model output data sets at little more than the cost of one . we integrate output from hidden markov models into the association rule mining framework , demonstrating the potential for frequent pattern mining in the field of scientific modeling and experimentation .

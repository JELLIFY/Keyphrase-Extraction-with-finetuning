performance enhancement of scheduling algorithms in clusters and grids using improved dynamic load balancing techniques this paper describes the research work done for during phd study . cluster computing , grid computing and cloud computing are distributed computing environments ( dces ) widely accepted for the next generation web based commercial and scientific applications . these applications work around the globally distributed data of petabyte scale that can only be processed by the aggregating the capability of globally distributed resources . the resource management and process scheduling in large scale distributed computing environment are a challenging task . in this research work we have devised new scheduling algorithms and resource management strategies specially designed for the cluster and grid cloud and peer-to-peer computing . the research work finally presented the distributed computing solutions to one scientific and one commercial application viz . e-learning and data mining .

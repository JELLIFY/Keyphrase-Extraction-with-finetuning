naïve filterbots for robust cold-start recommendations the goal of a recommender system is to suggest items of interest to a user based on historical behavior of a community of users . given detailed enough history , item-based collaborative filtering ( cf ) often performs as well or better than almost any other recommendation method . however , in cold-start situations - where a user , an item , or the entire system is new - simple non-personalized recommendations often fare better . we improve the scalability and performance of a previous approach to handling cold-start situations that uses filterbots , or surrogate users that rate items based only on user or item attributes . we show that introducing a very small number of simple filterbots helps make cf algorithms more robust . in particular , adding just seven global filterbots improves both user-based and item-based cf in cold-start user , cold-start item , and cold-start system settings . performance is better when data is scarce , performance is no worse when data is plentiful , and algorithm efficiency is negligibly affected . we systematically compare a non-personalized baseline , user-based cf , item-based cf , and our bot-augmented user - and item-based cf algorithms using three data sets ( yahoo ! movies , movielens , and eachmovie ) with the normalized mae metric in three types of cold-start situations . the advantage of our `` naïve filterbot '' approach is most pronounced for the yahoo ! data , the sparsest of the three data sets .

fast query execution for retrieval models based on path-constrained random walks many recommendation and retrieval tasks can be represented as proximity queries on a labeled directed graph , with typed nodes representing documents , terms , and metadata , and labeled edges representing the relationships between them . recent work has shown that the accuracy of the widely-used random-walk-based proximity measures can be improved by supervised learning - in particular , one especially effective learning technique is based on path-constrained random walks ( pcrw ) , in which similarity is defined by a learned combination of constrained random walkers , each constrained to follow only a particular sequence of edge labels away from the query nodes . the pcrw based method significantly outperformed unsupervised random walk based queries , and models with learned edge weights . unfortunately , pcrw query systems are expensive to evaluate . in this study we evaluate the use of approximations to the computation of the pcrw distributions , including fingerprinting , particle filtering , and truncation strategies . in experiments on several recommendation and retrieval problems using two large scientific publications corpora we show speedups of factors of 2 to 100 with little loss in accuracy .

compositional knowledge management for medical services on semantic web the vision of the semantic web is to reduce manual discovery and usage of web resources ( documents and services ) and to allow software agents to automatically identify these web resources , integrate them and execute them for achieving the intended goals of the user . such a composed web service may be represented as a workflow , called service flow . current web service standards are not sufficient for automatic composition . this paper presents different types of compositional knowledge required for web service discovery and composition . as a proof of concept , we have implemented our framework in a cardiovascular domain which requires advanced service discovery and composition across heterogeneous platforms of multiple organizations .

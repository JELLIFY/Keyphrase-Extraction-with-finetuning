incremental maintenance for materialized xpath\/xslt views this paper proposes an incremental maintenance algorithm that efficiently updates the materialized xpath\/xslt views defined using xpath expressions in xp ( ( ) , \* , \/ \/ , vars ) . the algorithm consists of two processes . 1 ) the dynamic execution flow of an xslt program is stored as an xt ( xml transformation ) tree during the full transformation . 2 ) in response to a source xml data update , the impacted portions of the xt-tree are identified and maintained by partially re-evaluating the xslt program . this paper discusses the xpath\/xslt features of incremental view maintenance for subtree insertion\/deletion and applies them to the maintenance algorithm . experiments show that the incremental maintenance algorithm outperforms full xml transformation algorithms by factors of up to 500 .

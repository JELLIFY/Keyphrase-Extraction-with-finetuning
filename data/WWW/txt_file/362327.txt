schemapath , a minimal extension to xml schema for conditional constraints in the past few years , a number of constraint languages for xml documents has been proposed . they are cumulatively called schema languages or validation languages and they comprise , among others , dtd , xml schema , relax ng , schematron , dsd , xlinkit . one major point of discrimination among schema languages is the support of co-constraints , or co-occurrence constraints , e.g. , requiring that attribute a is present if and only if attribute b is ( or is not ) presentin the same element . although there is no way in xml schema to express these requirements , they are in fact frequently used in many xml document types , usually only expressed in plain human-readable text , and validated by means of special code modules by the relevant applications . in this paper we propose schemapath , a light extension of xml schema to handle conditional constraints on xml documents . two new constructs have been added to xml schema : conditions -- based on xpath patterns -- on type assignments for elements and attributes ; and a new simple type , xsd : error , for the direct expression of negative constraints ( e.g. it is prohibited for attribute a to be present if attribute b is also present ) . a proof-of-concept implementation is provided . a web interface is publicly accessible for experiments and assessments of the real expressiveness of the proposed extension .

rankcompete : simultaneous ranking and clustering of web photos with the explosive growth of digital cameras and online media , it has become crucial to design efficient methods that help users browse and search large image collections . the recent visualrank algorithm ( 4 ) employs visual similarity to represent the link structure in a graph so that the classic pagerank algorithm can be applied to select the most relevant images . however , measuring visual similarity is difficult when there exist diversified semantics in the image collection , and the results from visualrank can not supply good visual summarization with diversity . this paper proposes to rank the images in a structural fashion , which aims to discover the diverse structure embedded in photo collections , and rank the images according to their similarity among local neighborhoods instead of across the entire photo collection . we design a novel algorithm named rankcompete , which generalizes the pagerank algorithm for the task of simultaneous ranking and clustering . the experimental results show that rankcompete outperforms visualrank and provides an efficient but effective tool for organizing web photos .

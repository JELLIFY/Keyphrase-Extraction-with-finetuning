extracting semantic structure of web documents using content and visual information this work aims to provide a page segmentation algorithm which uses both visual and content information to extract the semantic structure of a web page . the visual information is utilized using the vips algorithm and the content information using a pre-trained naive bayes classifier . the output of the algorithm is a semantic structure tree whose leaves represent segments having unique topic . however contents of the leaf segments may possibly be physically distributed in the web page . this structure can be useful in many web applications like information retrieval , information extraction and automatic web page adaptation . this algorithm is expected to outperform other existing page segmentation algorithms since it utilizes both content and visual information .

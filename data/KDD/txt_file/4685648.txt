applying collaborative filtering techniques to movie search for better ranking and browsing we propose a new ranking method , which combines recommender systems with information search tools for better search and browsing . our method uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to generate personal item authorities for each user and combines them with item proximities for better ranking . to demonstrate our approach , we build a prototype movie search and browsing engine called mad6 ( movies , actors and directors ; 6 degrees of separation ) . we conduct offline and online tests of our ranking algorithm . for offline testing , we use yahoo ! search queries that resulted in a click on a yahoo ! movies or internet movie database ( imdb ) movie url . our online test involved 44 yahoo ! employees providing subjective assessments of results quality . in both tests , our ranking methods show significantly better recall and quality than imdb search and yahoo ! movies current search .

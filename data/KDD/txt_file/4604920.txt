incremental maintenance of quotient cube for median data cube pre-computation is an important concept for supporting olap ( online analytical processing ) and has been studied extensively . it is often not feasible to compute a complete data cube due to the huge storage requirement . recently proposed quotient cube addressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalence partitions . such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such as sum but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like median . maintaining a data cube for holistic aggregation is a hard problem since its difficulty lies in the fact that history tuple values must be kept in order to compute the new aggregate when tuples are inserted or deleted . the quotient cube makes the problem harder since we also need to maintain the equivalence classes . in this paper , we introduce two techniques called addset data structure and sliding window to deal with this problem . we develop efficient algorithms for maintaining a quotient cube with holistic aggregation functions that takes up reasonably small storage space . performance study shows that our algorithms are effective , efficient and scalable over large databases .

transforming data to satisfy privacy constraints data on individuals and entities are being collected widely . these data can contain information that explicitly identifies the individual ( e.g. , social security number ) . data can also contain other kinds of personal information ( e.g. , date of birth , zip code , gender ) that are potentially identifying when linked with other available data sets . data are often shared for business or legal reasons . this paper addresses the important issue of preserving the anonymity of the individuals or entities during the data dissemination process . we explore preserving the anonymity by the use of generalizations and suppressions on the potentially identifying portions of the data . we extend earlier works in this area along various dimensions . first , satisfying privacy constraints is considered in conjunction with the usage for the data being disseminated . this allows us to optimize the process of preserving privacy for the specified usage . in particular , we investigate the privacy transformation in the context of data mining applications like building classification and regression models . second , our work improves on previous approaches by allowing more flexible generalizations for the data . lastly , this is combined with a more thorough exploration of the solution space using the genetic algorithm framework . these extensions allow us to transform the data so that they are more useful for their intended purpose while satisfying the privacy constraints .

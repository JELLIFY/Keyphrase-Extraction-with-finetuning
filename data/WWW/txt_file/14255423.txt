serf and turf : crowdturfing for fun and profit popular internet services in recent years have shown that remarkable things can be achieved by harnessing the power of the masses using crowd-sourcing systems . however , crowd-sourcing systems can also pose a real challenge to existing security mechanisms deployed to protect internet services . many of these security techniques rely on the assumption that malicious activity is generated automatically by automated programs . thus they would perform poorly or be easily bypassed when attacks are generated by real users working in a crowd-sourcing system . through measurements , we have found surprising evidence showing that not only do malicious crowd-sourcing systems exist , but they are rapidly growing in both user base and total revenue . we describe in this paper a significant effort to study and understand these `` crowdturfing '' systems in today 's internet . we use detailed crawls to extract data about the size and operational structure of these crowdturfing systems . we analyze details of campaigns offered and performed in these sites , and evaluate their end-to-end effectiveness by running active , benign campaigns of our own . finally , we study and compare the source of workers on crowdturfing sites in different countries . our results suggest that campaigns on these systems are highly effective at reaching users , and their continuing growth poses a concrete threat to online communities both in the us and elsewhere .

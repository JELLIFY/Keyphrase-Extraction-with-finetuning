social action tracking via noise tolerant time-varying factor graphs it is well known that users ' behaviors ( actions ) in a social network are influenced by various factors such as personal interests , social influence , and global trends . however , few publications systematically study how social actions evolve in a dynamic social network and to what extent different factors affect the user actions . in this paper , we propose a noise tolerant time-varying factor graph model ( ntt-fgm ) for modeling and predicting social actions . ntt-fgm simultaneously models social network structure , user attributes and user action history for better prediction of the users ' future actions . more specifically , a user 's action at time t is generated by her latent state at t , which is influenced by her attributes , her own latent state at time t-1 and her neighbors ' states at time t and t-1 . based on this intuition , we formalize the social action tracking problem using the ntt-fgm model ; then present an efficient algorithm to learn the model , by combining the ideas from both continuous linear system and markov random field . finally , we present a case study of our model on predicting future social actions . we validate the model on three different types of real-world data sets . qualitatively , our model can uncover some interesting patterns of the social dynamics . quantitatively , experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods for action prediction .

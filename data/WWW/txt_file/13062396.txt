a framework for evaluating network measures for functional importance many metrics such as degree , closeness , and pagerank have been introduced to determine the relative importance of a node within a network . the desired function of a network , however , is domain-specific . for example , the robustness can be crucial for a communication network , while efficiency is more preferred for fast spreading of advertisements in viral marketing . the information provided by some widely used measures are often conflicting under such varying demands . in this paper , we present a novel framework for evaluating network metrics regarding typical functional requirements . we also propose an analysis of five well established measures to compare their performance of ranking nodes on functional importance in a real-life network .

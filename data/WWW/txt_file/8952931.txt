wireless soap : optimizations for mobile wireless web services we propose a set of optimization techniques , collectively called wireless soap ( wsoap ) , to compress soap messages transmitted across a wireless link . the name space equivalency technique rests on the observation that exact recovery of compressed messages is not required at the receiver ; an equivalent form suffices . the wsdl aware encoding technique obtains further savings by utilizing knowledge of the underlying wsdl by means of an offline protocol we define . we summarize the design , implementation and performance of our wireless soap prototype , and show that wireless soap can reduce message sizes by 3x-12x compared to soap .

document preprocessing for naive bayes classification and clustering with mixture of multinomials naive bayes classifier has long been used for text categorization tasks . its sibling from the unsupervised world , the probabilistic mixture of multinomial models , has likewise been successfully applied to text clustering problems . despite the strong independence assumptions that these models make , their attractiveness come from low computational cost , relatively low memory consumption , ability to handle heterogeneous features and multiple classes , and often competitiveness with the top of the line models . recently , there has been several attempts to alleviate the problems of naive bayes by performing heuristic feature transformations , such as idf , normalization by the length of the documents and taking the logarithms of the counts . we justify the use of these techniques and apply them to two problems : classification of products in yahoo ! shopping and clustering the vectors of collocated terms in user queries to yahoo ! search . the experimental evaluation allows us to draw conclusions about the promise that these transformations carry with regard to alleviating the strong assumptions of the multinomial model .

reappraising cognitive styles in adaptive web applications the mechanisms for personalisation used in web applications are currently the subject of much debate amongst researchers from many diverse subject areas . one of the most contemporary ideas for user modelling in web applications is that of cognitive styles , where a user 's psychological preferences are assessed stored in a database and then used to provide personalised content and\/or links . we describe user trials of a case study that utilises visual-verbal preferences in an adaptive web-based educational system ( awbes ) . students in this trial were assessed by the felder-solomon inventory of learning styles ( ils ) instrument , and their preferences were used as a means of content personalisation . contrary to previous findings by other researchers , we found no significant differences in performance between matched and mismatched students . conclusions are drawn about the value and validity of using cognitive styles as a way of modelling user preferences in educational web applications .

beyond position bias : examining result attractiveness as a source of presentation bias in clickthrough data leveraging clickthrough data has become a popular approach for evaluating and optimizing information retrieval systems . although data is plentiful , one must take care when interpreting clicks , since user behavior can be affected by various sources of presentation bias . while the issue of position bias in clickthrough data has been the topic of much study , other presentation bias effects have received comparatively little attention . for instance , since users must decide whether to click on a result based on its summary ( e.g. , the title , url and abstract ) , one might expect clicks to favor `` more attractive '' results . in this paper , we examine result summary attractiveness as a potential source of presentation bias . this study distinguishes itself from prior work by aiming to detect systematic biases in click behavior due to attractive summaries inflating perceived relevance . our experiments conducted on the google web search engine show substantial evidence of presentation bias in clicks towards results with more attractive titles .

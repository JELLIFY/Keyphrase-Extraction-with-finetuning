using structure indices for efficient approximation of network properties statistics on networks have become vital to the study of relational data drawn from areas such as bibliometrics , fraud detection , bioinformatics , and the internet . calculating many of the most important measures - such as betweenness centrality , closeness centrality , and graph diameter-requires identifying short paths in these networks . however , finding these short paths can be intractable for even moderate-size networks . we introduce the concept of a network structure index ( nsi ) , a composition of ( 1 ) a set of annotations on every node in the network and ( 2 ) a function that uses the annotations to estimate graph distance between pairs of nodes . we present several varieties of nsis , examine their time and space complexity , and analyze their performance on synthetic and real data sets . we show that creating an nsi for a given network enables extremely efficient and accurate estimation of a wide variety of network statistics on that network .

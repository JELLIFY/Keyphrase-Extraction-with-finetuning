information awareness : a prospective technical assessment recent proposals to apply data mining systems to problems in law enforcement , national security , and fraud detection have attracted both media attention and technical critiques of their expected accuracy and impact on privacy . unfortunately , the majority of technical critiques have been based on simplistic assumptions about data , classifiers , inference procedures , and the overall architecture of such systems . we consider these critiques in detail , and we construct a simulation model that more closely matches realistic systems . we show how both the accuracy and privacy impact of a hypothetical system could be substantially improved , and we discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for this improvement to be achieved . this analysis is neither a defense nor a critique of any particular system concept . rather , our model suggests alternative technical designs that could mitigate some concerns , but also raises more specific conditions that must be met for such systems to be both accurate and socially desirable .

a parallel learning algorithm for text classification text classification is the process of classifying documents into predefined categories based on their content . existing supervised learning algorithms to automatically classify text need sufficient labeled documents to learn accurately . applying the expectation-maximization ( em ) algorithm to this problem is an alternative approach that utilizes a large pool of unlabeled documents to augment the available labeled documents . unfortunately , the time needed to learn with these large unlabeled documents is too high . this paper introduces a novel parallel learning algorithm for text classification task . the parallel algorithm is based on the combination of the em algorithm and the naive bayes classifier . our goal is to improve the computational time in learning and classifying process . we studied the performance of our parallel algorithm on a large linux pc cluster called pirun cluster . we report both timing and accuracy results . these results indicate that the proposed parallel algorithm is capable of handling large document collections .

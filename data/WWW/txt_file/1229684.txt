bridging the gap between owl and relational databases schema statements in owl are interpreted quite differently from analogous statements in relational databases . if these statements are meant to be interpreted as integrity constraints ( ics ) , owl 's interpretation may seem confusing and\/or inappropriate . therefore , we propose an extension of owl with ics that captures the intuition behind ics in relational databases . we discuss the algorithms for checking ic satisfaction for different types of knowledge bases , and show that , if the constraints are satisfied , we can disregard them while answering a broad range of positive queries .

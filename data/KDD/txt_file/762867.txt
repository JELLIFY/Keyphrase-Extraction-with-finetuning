query-time entity resolution the goal of entity resolution is to reconcile database references corresponding to the same real-world entities . given the abundance of publicly available databases where entities are not resolved , we motivate the problem of quickly processing queries that require resolved entities from such ` unclean ' databases . we propose a two-stage collective resolution strategy for processing queries . we then show how it can be performed on-the-fly by adaptively extracting and resolving those database references that are the most helpful for resolving the query . we validate our approach on two large real-world publication databases where we show the usefulness of collective resolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies for query processing . we then show how the same queries can be answered in real time using our adaptive approach while preserving the gains of collective resolution .

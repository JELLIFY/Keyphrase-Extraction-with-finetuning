matching web site structure and content to keep an overview of a complex corporate web sites , it is crucial to understand the relationship of contents , structure and the user 's behavior . in this paper , we describe an approach which is allowing us to compare web page content with the information implictly defined by the structure of the web site . we start by describing each web page with a set of key words . we combine this information with the link structure in an algorithm generating a context based description . by comparing both descriptions , we draw conclusions about the semantic relationship of a web page and its neighborhood . in this way , we indicate whether a page fits in the content of its neighborhood . doing this , we implicitly identify topics which span over several connected web pages . with our approach we support redesign processes by assessing the actual structure and content of a web site with designer 's concepts .

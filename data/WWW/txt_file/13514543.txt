sofie : a self-organizing framework for information extraction this paper presents sofie , a system for automated ontology extension . sofie can parse natural language documents , extract ontological facts from them and link the facts into an ontology . sofie uses logical reasoning on the existing knowledge and on the new knowledge in order to disambiguate words to their most probable meaning , to reason on the meaning of text patterns and to take into account world knowledge axioms . this allows sofie to check the plausibility of hypotheses and to avoid inconsistencies with the ontology . the framework of sofie unites the paradigms of pattern matching , word sense disambiguation and ontological reasoning in one unified model . our experiments show that sofie delivers high-quality output , even from unstructured internet documents .

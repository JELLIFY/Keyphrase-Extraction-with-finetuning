a content-driven reputation system for the wikipedia we present a content-driven reputation system for wikipedia authors . in our system , authors gain reputation when the edits they perform to wikipedia articles are preserved by subsequent authors , and they lose reputation when their edits are rolled back or undone in short order . thus , author reputation is computed solely on the basis of content evolution ; user-to-user comments or ratings are not used . the author reputation we compute could be used to flag new contributions from low-reputation authors , or it could be used to allow only authors with high reputation to contribute to controversialor critical pages . a reputation system for the wikipedia could also provide an incentive for high-quality contributions . we have implemented the proposed system , and we have used it to analyze the entire italian and french wikipedias , consisting of a total of 691 , 551 pages and 5 , 587 , 523 revisions . our results show that our notion of reputation has good predictive value : changes performed by low-reputation authors have a significantly larger than average probability of having poor quality , as judged by human observers , and of being later undone , as measured by our algorithms .

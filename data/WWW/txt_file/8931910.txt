an agent system reasoning about the web and the user the paper describes some innovations related to the ongoing work on the gsa prototype , an integrated information retrieval agent . in order to improve the original system effectiveness , we propose the gsa2 system , introducing a new internal architecture based on a message-passing framework and on an ontology description formalism ( wolf , web ontology framework ) . gsa2 is conceived in order to describe and easily perform reasoning on `` facts about the web and the user '' . the most innovative aspect of the project is its customizable and flexible reasoning system , based on answer set programming it plays the role of the central decision making module , and allows the agent to take proactive decisions . the introduction of a logic language allows one to describe , program and plan behaviors of the agent easily and quickly , and to experiment with a large variety of information retrieval strategies . both the system architecture and wolf are general and reusable , and the result constitutes a good example of real implementation of agents based on logics .

template-based question answering over rdf data as an increasing amount of rdf data is published as linked data , intuitive ways of accessing this data become more and more important . question answering approaches have been proposed as a good compromise between intuitiveness and expressivity . most question answering systems translate questions into triples which are matched against the rdf data to retrieve an answer , typically relying on some similarity metric . however , in many cases , triples do not represent a faithful representation of the semantic structure of the natural language question , with the result that more expressive queries can not be answered . to circumvent this problem , we present a novel approach that relies on a parse of the question to produce a sparql template that directly mirrors the internal structure of the question . this template is then instantiated using statistical entity identification and predicate detection . we show that this approach is competitive and discuss cases of questions that can be answered with our approach but not with competing approaches .

a multinomial clustering model for fast simulation of computer architecture designs computer architects utilize simulation tools to evaluate the merits of a new design feature . the time needed to adequately evaluate the tradeoffs associated with adding any new feature has become a critical issue . recent work has found that by identifying execution phases present in common workloads used in simulation studies , we can apply clustering algorithms to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to complete the simulation . our goal in this paper is to demonstrate the value of this approach when applied to the set of industry-standard benchmarks most commonly used in computer architecture studies . we also look to improve upon prior work by applying more appropriate clustering algorithms to identify phases , and to further reduce simulation time . we find that the phase clustering in computer architecture simulation has many similarities to text clustering . in prior work on clustering techniques to reduce simulation time , k-means clustering was used to identify representative program phases . in this paper we apply a mixture of multinomials to the clustering problem and show its advantages over using k-means on simulation data . we have implemented these two clustering algorithms and evaluate how well they can characterize program behavior . by adopting a mixture of multinomials model , we find that we can maintain simulation result fidelity , while greatly reducing overall simulation time . we report results for a range of applications taken from the spec2000 benchmark suite .

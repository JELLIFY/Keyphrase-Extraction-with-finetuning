model-directed web transactions under constrained modalities online transactions ( e.g. , buying a book on the web ) typically involve a number of steps spanning several pages . conducting such transactions under constrained interaction modalities as exemplified by small screen handhelds or interactive speech interfaces - the primary mode of communication for visually impaired individuals - is a strenuous , fatigue-inducing activity . but usually one needs to browse only a small fragment of a web page to perform a transactional step such as a form fillout , selecting an item from a search results list , etc. . we exploit this observation to develop an automata-based process model that delivers only the `` relevant '' page fragments at each transactional step , thereby reducing information overload on such narrow interaction bandwidths . we realize this model by coupling techniques from content analysis of web documents , automata learning and statistical classification . the process model and associated techniques have been incorporated into guide-o , a prototype system that facilitates online transactions using speech\/keyboard interface ( guide-o-speech ) , or with limited-display size handhelds ( guide-o-mobile ) . performance of guide-o and its user experience are reported .

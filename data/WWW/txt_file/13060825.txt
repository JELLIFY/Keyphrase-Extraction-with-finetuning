statically locating web application bugs caused by asynchronous calls ajax becomes more and more important for web applications that care about client side user experience . it allows sending requests asynchronously , without blocking clients from continuing execution . callback functions are only executed upon receiving the responses . while such mechanism makes browsing a smooth experience , it may cause severe problems in the presence of unexpected network latency , due to the non-determinism of asynchronism . in this paper , we demonstrate the possible problems caused by the asynchronism and propose a static program analysis to automatically detect such bugs in web applications . as client side ajax code is often wrapped in server-side scripts , we also develop a technique that extracts client-side javascript code from server-side scripts . we evaluate our technique on a number of real-world web applications . our results show that it can effectively identify real bugs . we also discuss possible ways to avoid such bugs .

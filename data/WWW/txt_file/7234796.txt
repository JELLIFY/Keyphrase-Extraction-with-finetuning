spath : a path language for xml schema xml is increasingly being used as a typed data format , and therefore it becomes more important to gain access to the type system ; very often this is an xml schema . the xml schema path language ( spath ) presented in this paper provides access to xml schema components by extending the well-known xpath language to also include the domain of xml schemas . using spath , xml developers gain access to xml schemas and thus can more easily develop software which is type - or schema-aware , and thus more robust .

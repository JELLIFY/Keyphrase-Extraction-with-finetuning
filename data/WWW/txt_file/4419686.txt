a framework for rapid integration of presentation components the development of user interfaces ( uis ) is one of the most time-consuming aspects in software development . in this context , the lack of proper reuse mechanisms for uis is increasingly becoming manifest , especially as software development is more and more moving toward composite applications . in this paper we propose a framework for the integration of stand-alone modules or applications , where integration occurs at the presentation layer . hence , the final goal is to reduce the effort required for ui development by maximizing reus . the design of the framework is inspired by lessons learned from application integration , appropriately modified to account for the specificity of the ui integration problem . we provide an abstract component model to specify characteristics and behaviors of presentation components and propose an event-based composition model to specify the composition logic . components and composition are described by means of a simple xml-based language , which is interpreted by a runtime middleware for the execution of the resulting composite application . a proof-of-concept prototype allows us to show that the proposed component model can also easily be applied to existing presentation components , built with different languages and\/or component technologies .

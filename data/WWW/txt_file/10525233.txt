pake-based mutual http authentication for preventing phishing attacks we developed a new web authentication protocol with password-based mutual authentication which prevents various kinds of phishing attacks . this protocol provides a protection of user 's passwords against any phishers even if a dictionary attack is employed , and prevents phishers from imitating a false sense of successful authentication to users . the protocol is designed considering interoperability with many recent web applications which requires many features which current http authentication does not provide . the protocol is proposed as an internet draft submitted to ietf , and implemented in both server side ( as an apache extension ) and client side ( as a mozilla-based browser and an ie-based one ) .

exploiting the deep web with dynabot : matching , probing , and ranking we present the design of dynabot , a guided deep web discovery system . dynabot 's modular architecture supports focused crawling of the deep web with an emphasis on matching , probing , and ranking discovered sources using two key components : service class descriptions and source-biased analysis . we describe the overall architecture of dynabot and discuss how these components support effective exploitation of the massive deep web data available .

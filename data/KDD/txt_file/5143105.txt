nonlinear adaptive distance metric learning for clustering a good distance metric is crucial for many data mining tasks . to learn a metric in the unsupervised setting , most metric learning algorithms project observed data to a low-dimensional manifold , where geometric relationships such as pairwise distances are preserved . it can be extended to the nonlinear case by applying the kernel trick , which embeds the data into a feature space by specifying the kernel function that computes the dot products between data points in the feature space . in this paper , we propose a novel unsupervised nonlinear adaptive metric learning algorithm , called naml , which performs clustering and distance metric learning simultaneously . naml firstmaps the data to a high-dimensional space through a kernel function ; then applies a linear projection to find a low-dimensional manifold where the separability of the data is maximized ; and finally performs clustering in the low-dimensional space . the performance of naml depends on the selection of the kernel function and the projection . we show that the joint kernel learning , dimensionality reduction , and clustering can be formulated as a trace maximization problem , which can be solved via an iterative procedure in the em framework . experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed algorithm .

fast direction-aware proximity for graph mining in this paper we study asymmetric proximity measures on directed graphs , which quantify the relationships between two nodes or two groups of nodes . the measures are useful in several graph mining tasks , including clustering , link prediction and connection subgraph discovery . our proximity measure is based on the conceptof escape probability . this way , we strive to summarize the multiple facets of nodes-proximity , while avoiding some of the pitfalls to which alternative proximity measures are susceptible . a unique feature of the measures is accounting for the underlying directional information . we put a special emphasis on computational efficiency , and develop fast solutions that are applicable in several settings . our experimental study shows the usefulness of our proposed direction-aware proximity method for several applications , and that our algorithms achieve a significant speedup ( up to 50,000 x ) over straight forward implementations .

extensible schema documentation with xslt 2.0 xml schema documents are defined using an xml syntax , which means that the idea of generating schema documentation through standard xml technologies is intriguing . we present x2doc , a framework for generating schema-documentation solely through xslt . the framework uses scx , an xml syntax for xml schema components , as intermediate format and produces xml-based output formats . using a modular set of xslt stylesheets , x2doc is highly configurable and carefully crafted towards extensibility . this proves especially useful for composite schemas , where additional schema information like schematron rules are embedded into xml schemas .

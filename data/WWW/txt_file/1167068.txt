semantic virtual environments today 's virtual environment ( ve ) systems share a number of issues with the html-based world wide web . their content is usually designed for presentation to humans , and thus is not suitable for machine access . this is complicated by the large number of different data models and network protocols in use . accordingly , it is difficult to develop ve software , such as agents , services , and tools . in this paper we adopt the semantic web idea to the field of virtual environments . using the resource description framework ( rdf ) we establish a machine-understandable abstraction of existing ve systems -- the semantic virtual environments ( sve ) . on this basis it is possible to develop system-independent software , which could even operate across ve system boundaries .

highly scalable web applications with zero-copy data transfer the performance of server-side applications is becoming increasingly important as more applications exploit the web application model . extensive work has been done to improve the performance of individual software components such as web servers and programming language runtimes . this paper describes a novel approach to boost web application performance by improving inter-process communication between a programming language runtime and web server runtime . the approach reduces redundant processing for memory copying and the context switch overhead between user space and kernel space by exploiting the zero-copy data transfer methodology , such as the sendfile system call . in order to transparently utilize this optimization feature with existing web applications , we propose enhancements of the php runtime , fastcgi protocol , and web server . our proposed approach achieves a 126 % performance improvement with micro-benchmarks and a 44 % performance improvement for a standard web benchmark , specweb2005 .

wpbench : a benchmark for evaluating the client-side performance of web 2.0 applications in this paper , a benchmark called wpbench is reported to evaluate the responsiveness of web browsers for modern web 2.0 applications . in wpbench , variations of servers and networks are removed and the benchmark result is the closest to what web users would perceive . to achieve these , wpbench records users ' interactions with typical web 2.0 applications , and then replays web navigations when benchmarking browsers . the replay mechanism can emulate the actual user interactions and the characteristics of the servers and the networks in a consistent way independent of browsers so that any browser compliant to the standards can be benchmarked fairly . in addition to describing the design and generation of wpbench , we also report the wpbench comparison results on the responsiveness performance for three popular web browsers : internet explorer , firefox and chrome .

object views : fine-grained sharing in browsers browsers do not currently support the secure sharing of javascript objects between principals . we present this problem as the need for object views , which are consistent and controllable versions of objects . multiple views can be made for the same object and customized for the recipients . we implement object views with a javascript library that wraps shared objects and interposes on all access attempts . the security challenge is to fully mediate access to objects shared through a view and prevent privilege escalation . we discuss how object views can be deployed in two settings : same-origin sharing with rewriting-based javascript isolation systems like google caja , and inter-origin sharing between browser frames over a message-passing channel . to facilitate simple document sharing , we build a policy system for declaratively defining policies for document object views . notably , our document policy system makes it possible to hide elements without breaking document structure invariants . developers can control the fine-grained behavior of object views with an aspect system that accepts programmatic policies .

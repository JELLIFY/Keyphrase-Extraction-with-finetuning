outlier detection by sampling with accuracy guarantees an effective approach to detecting anomalous points in a data set is distance-based outlier detection . this paper describes a simple sampling algorithm to effciently detect distance-based outliers in domains where each and every distance computation is very expensive . unlike any existing algorithms , the sampling algorithm requires a xed number of distance computations and can return good results with accuracy guarantees . the most computationally expensive aspect of estimating the accuracy of the result is sorting all of the distances computed by the sampling algorithm . the experimental study on two expensive domains as well as ten additional real-life datasets demonstrates both the effciency and effectiveness of the sampling algorithm in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithm and there liability of the accuracy guarantees .

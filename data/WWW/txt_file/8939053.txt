time-based contextualized-news browser ( t-cnb ) we propose a new way of browsing contextualized-news articles . our prototype browser system is called a time-based contextualized-news browser ( t-cnb ) . the t-cnb concurrently and automatically presents a series of related pages for one news source while browsing the user-specified page . it extracts the past related pages from a user-specified news articles on the web . the related pages outline the progress of user-specified news articles . we call the related pages ` contextual pages ' . using the t-cnb , a user only needs to specify one news article on the web . the user then automatically receives past related news articles , which provide a wider understanding of the topic . the t-cnb automatically generates and presents contextualized news articles .

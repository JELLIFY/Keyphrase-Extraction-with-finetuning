new em derived from kullback-leibler divergence we introduce a new em framework in which it is possible not only to optimize the model parameters but also the number of model components . a key feature of our approach is that we use nonparametric density estimation to improve parametric density estimation in the em framework . while the classical em algorithm estimates model parameters empirically using the data points themselves , we estimate them using nonparametric density estimates . there exist many possible applications that require optimal adjustment of model components . we present experimental results in two domains . one is polygonal approximation of laser range data , which is an active research topic in robot navigation . the other is grouping of edge pixels to contour boundaries , which still belongs to unsolved problems in computer vision .

smartback : supporting users in back navigation this paper presents the design and user evaluation of smartback , a feature that complements the standard back button by enabling users to jump directly to key pages in their navigation session , making common navigation activities more efficient . defining key pages was informed by the findings of a user study that involved detailed monitoring of web usage and analysis of web browsing in terms of navigation trails . the pages accessible through smartback are determined automatically based on the structure of the user 's navigation trails or page association with specific user 's activities , such as search or browsing bookmarked sites . we discuss implementation decisions and present results of a usability study in which we deployed the smartback prototype and monitored usage for a month in both corporate and home settings . the results show that the feature brings qualitative improvement to the browsing experience of individuals who use it .

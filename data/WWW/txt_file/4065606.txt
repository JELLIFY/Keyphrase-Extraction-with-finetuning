learning block importance models for web pages previous work shows that a web page can be partitioned into multiple segments or blocks , and often the importance of those blocks in a page is not equivalent . also , it has been proven that differentiating noisy or unimportant blocks from pages can facilitate web mining , search and accessibility . however , no uniform approach and model has been presented to measure the importance of different segments in web pages . through a user study , we found that people do have a consistent view about the importance of blocks in web pages . in this paper , we investigate how to find a model to automatically assign importance values to blocks in a web page . we define the block importance estimation as a learning problem . first , we use a vision-based page segmentation algorithm to partition a web page into semantic blocks with a hierarchical structure . then spatial features ( such as position and size ) and content features ( such as the number of images and links ) are extracted to construct a feature vector for each block . based on these features , learning algorithms are used to train a model to assign importance to different segments in the web page . in our experiments , the best model can achieve the performance with micro-f1 79 % and micro-accuracy 85.9 % , which is quite close to a person 's view .

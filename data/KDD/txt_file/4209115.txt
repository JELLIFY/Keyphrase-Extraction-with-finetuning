cancer genomics throughout life , the cells in every individual accumulate many changes in the dna inherited from his or her parents . certain combinations of changes lead to cancer . during the last decade , the cost of dna sequencing has been dropping by a factor of 10 every two years , making it now possible to read most of the three billion base genome from a patient 's cancer tumor , and to try to determine all of the thousands of dna changes in it . under the auspices of nci 's cancer genome atlas project , 10,000 tumors will be sequenced in this manner in the next few years . soon cancer genome sequencing will be a widespread clinical practice , and millions of tumors will be sequenced . a massive computational problem looms in interpreting these data . first , because we can only read short pieces of dna , we have the enormous problem of assembling a coherent and reliable representation of the tumor genome from massive amounts of incomplete and error-prone evidence . this is the first challenge . second , every human genome is unique from birth , and every tumor a unique variant . there is no single route to cancer . we must learn to read the varied signatures of cancer within the tumor genome and associate these with optimal treatments . already there are hundreds of molecularly targeted treatments for cancer available , each known to be more or less effective depending on specific genetic variants . however , targeting a single gene with one treatment rarely works . the second challenge is to tackle the combinatorics of personalized , targeted , combination therapy in cancer .

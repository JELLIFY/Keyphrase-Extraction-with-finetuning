a proposal for an owl rules language although the owlweb ontology language adds considerable expressive power to the semantic web it does have expressive limitations , particularly with respect to what can be said about properties . wepresent orl ( owl rules language ) , a horn clause rules extension to owl that overcomes many of these limitations . orl extends owl in a syntactically and semantically coherent manner : the basic syntax for orl rules is an extension of the abstract syntax for owl dl and owllite ; orl rules are given formal meaning via an extension of the owldl model-theoretic semantics ; orl rules are given an xml syntax basedon the owl xml presentation syntax ; and a mapping from orl rules to rdf graphs is given based on the owl rdf\/xml exchange syntax . wediscuss the expressive power of orl , showing that the ontology consistency problem is undecidable , provide several examples of orlusage , and discuss how reasoning support for orl might be provided .

xml screamer : an integrated approach to high performance xml parsing , validation and deserialization this paper describes an experimental system in which customized high performance xml parsers are prepared using parser generation and compilation techniques . parsing is integrated with schema-based validation and deserialization , and the resulting validating processors are shown to be as fast as or in many cases significantly faster than traditional nonvalidating parsers . high performance is achieved by integration across layers of software that are traditionally separate , by avoiding unnecessary data copying and transformation , and by careful attention to detail in the generated code . the effect of api design on xml performance is also briefly discussed . .

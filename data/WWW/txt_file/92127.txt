description logic programs : combining logic programs with description logic we show how to interoperate , semantically and inferentially , between the leading semantic web approaches to rules ( ruleml logic programs ) and ontologies ( owl\/daml + oil description logic ) via analyzing their expressive intersection . to do so , we define a new intermediate knowledge representation ( kr ) contained within this intersection : description logic programs ( dlp ) , and the closely related description horn logic ( dhl ) which is an expressive fragment of first-order logic ( fol ) . dlp provides a significant degree of expressiveness , substantially greater than the rdf-schema fragment of description logic . we show how to perform dlp-fusion : the bidirectional translation of premises and inferences ( including typical kinds of queries ) from the dlp fragment of dl to lp , and vice versa from the dlp fragment of lp to dl . in particular , this translation enables one to `` build rules on top of ontologies '' : it enables the rule kr to have access to dl ontological definitions for vocabulary primitives ( e.g. , predicates and individual constants ) used by the rules . conversely , the dlp-fusion technique likewise enables one to `` build ontologies on top of rules '' : it enables ontological definitions to be supplemented by rules , or imported into dl from rules . it also enables available efficient lp inferencing algorithms\/implementations to be exploited for reasoning over large-scale dl ontologies .

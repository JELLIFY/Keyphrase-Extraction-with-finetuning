sleeved coclustering a cocluster of a m x n matrix x is a submatrix determined by a subset of the rows and a subset of the columns . the problem of finding coclusters with specific properties is of interest , in particular , in the analysis of microarray experiments . in that case the entries of the matrix x are the expression levels of $ m $ genes in each of $ n $ tissue samples . one goal of the analysis is to extract a subset of the samples and a subset of the genes , such that the expression levels of the chosen genes behave similarly across the subset of the samples , presumably reflecting an underlying regulatory mechanism governing the expression level of the genes . we propose to base the similarity of the genes in a cocluster on a simple biological model , in which the strength of the regulatory mechanism in sample j is hj , and the response strength of gene i to the regulatory mechanism is gi . in other words , every two genes participating in a good cocluster should have expression values in each of the participating samples , whose ratio is a constant depending only on the two genes . noise in the expression levels of genes is taken into account by allowing a deviation from the model , measured by a relative error criterion . the sleeve-width of the cocluster reflects the extent to which entry i , j in the cocluster is allowed to deviate , relatively , from being expressed as the product gihj . we present a polynomial-time monte-carlo algorithm which outputs a list of coclusters whose sleeve-widths do not exceed a prespecified value . moreover , we prove that the list includes , with fixed probability , a cocluster which is near-optimal in its dimensions . extensive experimentation with synthetic data shows that the algorithm performs well .

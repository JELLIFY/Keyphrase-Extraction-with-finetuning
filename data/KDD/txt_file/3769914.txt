fast best-effort pattern matching in large attributed graphs we focus on large graphs where nodes have attributes , such as a social network where the nodes are labeled with each person 's job title . in such a setting , we want to find subgraphs that match a user query pattern . for example , a `` star '' query would be , `` find a ceo who has strong interactions with a manager , a lawyer , and an accountant , or another structure as close to that as possible '' . similarly , a `` loop '' query could help spot a money laundering ring . traditional sql-based methods , as well as more recent graph indexing methods , will return no answer when an exact match does not exist . this is the first main feature of our method . it can find exact - , as well as near-matches , and it will present them to the user in our proposed `` goodness '' order . for example , our method tolerates indirect paths between , say , the `` ceo '' and the `` accountant '' of the above sample query , when direct paths do n't exist . its second feature is scalability . in general , if the query has nq nodes and the data graph has n nodes , the problem needs polynomial time complexity o ( n n q ) , which is prohibitive . our g-ray ( `` graph x-ray '' ) method finds high-quality subgraphs in time linear on the size of the data graph . experimental results on the dlbp author-publication graph ( with 356k nodes and 1.9 m edges ) illustrate both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach . the results agree with our intuition , and the speed is excellent . it takes 4 seconds on average fora 4-node query on the dblp graph .

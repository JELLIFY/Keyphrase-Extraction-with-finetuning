duplicate detection in click streams we consider the problem of finding duplicates in data streams . duplicate detection in data streams is utilized in various applications including fraud detection . we develop a solution based on bloom filters ( 9 ) , and discuss the space and time requirements for running the proposed algorithm in both the contexts of sliding , and landmark stream windows . we run a comprehensive set of experiments , using both real and synthetic click streams , to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution . the results demonstrate that the proposed solution yields extremely low error rates .

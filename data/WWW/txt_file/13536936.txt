raise semantics at the user level for dynamic and interactive soa-based portals in this paper , we describe the fully dynamic semantic portal we implemented , integrating semantic web technologies and service oriented architecture ( soa ) . the goals of the portal are twofold : first it helps administrators to easily propose new features in the portal using semantics to ease the orchestration process ; secondly it automatically generates a customized user interface for these scenarios . this user interface takes into account different devices and assists end-users in the use of the portal taking benefit of context awareness . all the added-value of this portal is based on a core semantics defined by an ontology . we present here the main features of this portal and how it was implemented using state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks .

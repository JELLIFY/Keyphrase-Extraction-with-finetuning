search engines and their public interfaces : which apis are the most synchronized ? researchers of commercial search engines often collect datausing the application programming interface ( api ) or by `` scraping '' results from the web user interface ( wui ) , butanecdotal evidence suggests the interfaces produce differentresults . we provide the first in-depth quantitative analysisof the results produced by the google , msn and yahoo apiand wui interfaces . after submitting a variety of queriesto the interfaces for 5 months , we found significant discrepanciesin several categories . our findings suggest that theapi indexes are not older , but they are probably smaller for google and yahoo . researchers may use our findings tobetter understand the differences between the interfaces andchoose the best api for their particular types of queries .

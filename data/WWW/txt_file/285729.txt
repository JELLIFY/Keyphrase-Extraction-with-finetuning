topic-sensitive pagerank in the original pagerank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results , a single pagerank vector is computed , using the link structure of the web , to capture the relative `` importance '' of web pages , independent of any particular search query . to yield more accurate search results , we propose computing a set of pagerank vectors , biased using a set of representative topics , to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic . by using these ( precomputed ) biased pagerank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time , we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single , generic pagerank vector . for ordinary keyword search queries , we compute the topic-sensitive pagerank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords . for searches done in context ( e.g. , when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a web page ) , we compute the topic-sensitive pagerank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared .

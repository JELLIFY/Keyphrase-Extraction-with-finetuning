highlighting disputed claims on the web we describe dispute finder , a browser extension that alerts a user when information they read online is disputed by a source that they might trust . dispute finder examines the text on the page that the user is browsing and highlights any phrases that resemble known disputed claims . if a user clicks on a highlighted phrase then dispute finder shows them a list of articles that support other points of view . dispute finder builds a database of known disputed claims by crawling web sites that already maintain lists of disputed claims , and by allowing users to enter claims that they believe are disputed . dispute finder identifies snippets that make known disputed claims by running a simple textual entailment algorithm inside the browser extension , referring to a cached local copy of the claim database . in this paper , we explain the design of dispute finder , and the trade-offs between the various design decisions that we explored .

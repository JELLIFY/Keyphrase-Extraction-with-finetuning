dido : a disease-determinants ontology from web sources this paper introduces dido , a system providing convenient access to knowledge about factors involved in human diseases , automatically extracted from textual web sources . the knowledge base is bootstrapped by integrating entities from hand-crafted sources like mesh and omim . as these are short on relationships between dierent types of biomedical entities , dido employs flexible and robust pattern learning and constraint-based reasoning methods to automatically extract new relational facts from textual sources . these facts can then be iteratively added to the knowledge base . the result is a semantic graph of typed entities and relations between diseases , their symptoms , and their factors , with emphasis on environmental factors but covering also molecular determinants . we demonstrate the value of dido for knowledge discovery about causal factors and properties of complex diseases , including factor-disease chains .

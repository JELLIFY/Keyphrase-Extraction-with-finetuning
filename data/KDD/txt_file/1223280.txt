programming the k-means clustering algorithm in sql using sql has not been considered an efficient and feasible way to implement data mining algorithms . although this is true for many data mining , machine learning and statistical algorithms , this work shows it is feasible to get an efficient sql implementation of the well-known k-means clustering algorithm that can work on top of a relational dbms . the article emphasizes both correctness and performance . from a correctness point of view the article explains how to compute euclidean distance , nearest-cluster queries and updating clustering results in sql . from a performance point of view it is explained how to cluster large data sets defining and indexing tables to store and retrieve intermediate and final results , optimizing and avoiding joins , optimizing and simplifying clustering aggregations , and taking advantage of sufficient statistics . experiments evaluate scalability with synthetic data sets varying size and dimensionality . the proposed k-means implementation can cluster large data sets and exhibits linear scalability .

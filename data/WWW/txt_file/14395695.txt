beyond dwell time : estimating document relevance from cursor movements and other post-click searcher behavior result clickthrough statistics and dwell time on clicked results have been shown valuable for inferring search result relevance , but the interpretation of these signals can vary substantially for different tasks and users . this paper shows that that post-click searcher behavior , such as cursor movement and scrolling , provides additional clues for better estimating document relevance . to this end , we identify patterns of examination and interaction behavior that correspond to viewing a relevant or non-relevant document , and design a new post-click behavior ( pcb ) model to capture these patterns . to our knowledge , pcb is the first to successfully incorporate post-click searcher interactions such as cursor movements and scrolling on a landing page for estimating document relevance . we evaluate pcb on a dataset collected from a controlled user study that contains interactions gathered from hundreds of unique queries , result clicks , and page examinations . the experimental results show that pcb is significantly more effective than using page dwell time information alone , both for estimating the explicit judgments of each user , and for re-ranking the results using the estimated relevance .

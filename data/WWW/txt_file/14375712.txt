learning causality for news events prediction the problem we tackle in this work is , given a present news event , to generate a plausible future event that can be caused by the given event . we present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques . our pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor . to obtain precise labeled causality examples , we mine 150 years of news articles , and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to titles containing certain predefined causality patterns . for generalization , the model uses a vast amount of world knowledge ontologies mined from linkeddata , containing ~ 200 datasets with approximately 20 billion relations . empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our pundit algorithm reaches a human-level performance .

suggesting friends using the implicit social graph although users of online communication tools rarely categorize their contacts into groups such as `` family '' , `` co-workers '' , or `` jogging buddies '' , they nonetheless implicitly cluster contacts , by virtue of their interactions with them , forming implicit groups . in this paper , we describe the implicit social graph which is formed by users ' interactions with contacts and groups of contacts , and which is distinct from explicit social graphs in which users explicitly add other individuals as their `` friends '' . we introduce an interaction-based metric for estimating a user 's affinity to his contacts and groups . we then describe a novel friend suggestion algorithm that uses a user 's implicit social graph to generate a friend group , given a small seed set of contacts which the user has already labeled as friends . we show experimental results that demonstrate the importance of both implicit group relationships and interaction-based affinity ranking in suggesting friends . finally , we discuss two applications of the friend suggest algorithm that have been released as gmail labs features .

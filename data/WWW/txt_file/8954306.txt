boosting svm classifiers by ensemble by far , the support vector machines ( svm ) achieve the state-of-the-art performance for the text classification ( tc ) tasks . due to the complexity of the tc problems , it becomes a challenge to systematically develop classifiers with better performance . we try to attack this problem by ensemble methods , which are often used for boosting weak classifiers , such as decision tree , neural networks , etc. , and whether they are effective for strong classifiers is not clear .

analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services social networking services are a fast-growing business in the internet . however , it is unknown if online relationships and their growth patterns are the same as in real-life social networks . in this paper , we compare the structures of three online social networking services : cyworld , myspace , and orkut , each with more than 10 million users , respectively . we have access to complete data of cyworld 's ilchon ( friend ) relationships and analyze its degree distribution , clustering property , degree correlation , and evolution over time . we also use cyworld data to evaluate the validity of snowball sampling method , which we use to crawl and obtain partial network topologies of myspace and orkut . cyworld , the oldest of the three , demonstrates a changing scaling behavior over time in degree distribution . the latest cyworld data 's degree distribution exhibits a multi-scaling behavior , while those of myspace and orkut have simple scaling behaviors with different exponents . very interestingly , each of the two e ponents corresponds to the different segments in cyworld 's degree distribution . certain online social networking services encourage online activities that can not be easily copied in real life ; we show that they deviate from close-knit online social networks which show a similar degree correlation pattern to real-life social networks .

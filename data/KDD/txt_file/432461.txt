a refinement approach to handling model misfit in text categorization text categorization or classification is the automated assigning of text documents to pre-defined classes based on their contents . this problem has been studied in information retrieval , machine learning and data mining . so far , many effective techniques have been proposed . however , most techniques are based on some underlying models and\/or assumptions . when the data fits the model well , the classification accuracy will be high . however , when the data does not fit the model well , the classification accuracy can be very low . in this paper , we propose a refinement approach to dealing with this problem of model misfit . we show that we do not need to change the classification technique itself ( or its underlying model ) to make it more flexible . instead , we propose to use successive refinements of classification on the training data to correct the model misfit . we apply the proposed technique to improve the classification performance of two simple and efficient text classifiers , the rocchio classifier and the naïve bayesian classifier . these techniques are suitable for very large text collections because they allow the data to reside on disk and need only one scan of the data to build a text classifier . extensive experiments on two benchmark document corpora show that the proposed technique is able to improve text categorization accuracy of the two techniques dramatically . in particular , our refined model is able to improve the naïve bayesian or rocchio classifier 's prediction performance by 45 % on average .

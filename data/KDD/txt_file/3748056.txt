cryptographically private support vector machines we propose private protocols implementing the kernel adatron and kernel perceptron learning algorithms , give private classification protocols and private polynomial kernel computation protocols . the new protocols return their outputs - either the kernel value , the classifier or the classifications - in encrypted form so that they can be decrypted only by a common agreement by the protocol participants . we show how to use the encrypted classifications to privately estimate many properties of the data and the classifier . the new svm classifiers are the first to be proven private according to the standard cryptographic definitions .

liveclassifier : creating hierarchical text classifiers through web corpora many web information services utilize techniques of information extraction ( ie ) to collect important facts from the web . to create more advanced services , one possible method is to discover thematic information from the collected facts through text classification . however , most conventional text classification techniques rely on manual-labelled corpora and are thus ill-suited to cooperate with web information services with open domains . in this work , we present a system named liveclassifier that can automatically train classifiersthrough web corpora based on user-defined topic hierarchies . due to its flexibility and convenience , liveclassifier can be easily adapted for various purposes . new web information services can be created to fully exploit it ; human users can use it to create classifiers for their personal applications . the effectiveness of classifiers created by liveclassifier is well supportedby empirical evidence .

classification with partial labels in this paper , we address the problem of learning when some cases are fully labeled while other cases are only partially labeled , in the form of partial labels . partial labels are represented as a set of possible labels for each training example , one of which is the correct label . we introduce a discriminative learning approach that incorporates partial label information into the conventional margin-based learning framework . the partial label learning problem is formulated as a convex quadratic optimization minimizing the l2-norm regularized empirical risk using hinge loss . we also present an efficient algorithm for classification in the presence of partial labels . experiments with different data sets show that partial label information improves the performance of classification when there is traditional fully-labeled data , and also yields reasonable performance in the absence of any fully labeled data .

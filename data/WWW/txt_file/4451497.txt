temporal rules for mobile web personalization many systems use past behavior , preferences and environmental factors to attempt to predict user navigation on the internet . however we believe that many of these models have shortcomings , in that they do not take into account that users may have many different sets of preferences . here we investigate an environmental factor , namely time , in making predictions about user navigation . we present methods for creating temporal rules that describe user navigation patterns . we also show the benefit of using these rules to predict user navigation and also show the benefits of these models over traditional methods . an analysis is carried out on a sample of usage logs for wireless application protocol ( wap ) browsing , and the results of this analysis verify our hypothesis .

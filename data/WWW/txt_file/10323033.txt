automatic web service composition with abstraction and refinement the behavioral description based web service composition ( wsc ) problem aims at the automatic construction of a coordinator web service that controls a set of web services to reach a goal state . however , solving the wsc problem exactly with a realistic model is doubly-exponential in the number of variables in web service descriptions . in this paper , we propose a novel efficient approximation-based algorithm using automatic abstraction and refinement to dramatically reduce the number of variables needed to solve the problem .

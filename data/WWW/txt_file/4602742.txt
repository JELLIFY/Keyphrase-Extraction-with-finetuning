providing session management as core business service it is extremely hard for a global organization with services over multiple channels to capture a consistent and unified view of its data , services , and interactions . while soa and web services are addressing integration and interoperability problems , it is painful for an operational organization with legacy systems to quickly switch to service-based methods . we need methods to combine advantages of traditional ( i.e. web , desktop , or mobile ) application development environments and service-based deployments . in this paper , we focus on the design and implementation of session management as a core service to support business processes and go beyond application-specific sessions and web sessions . we develop local session components for different platforms and complement them with a remote `` session service '' that is independent of applications and platforms . we aim to close the gap between the two worlds by combining their performance , availability and interoperability advantages .

wiser : a web-based interactive route search system for smartphones many smartphones , nowadays , use gps to detect the location of the user , and can use the internet to interact with remote location-based services . these two capabilities support online navigation that incorporates search . in this demo we presents wiser -- a system for web-based interactive search en route . in the system , users perform route search by providing ( 1 ) a target location , and ( 2 ) search terms that specify types of geographic entities to be visited . the task is to find a route that minimizes the travel distance from the initial location of the user to the target , via entities of the specified types . however , planning a route under conditions of uncertainty requires the system to take into account the possibility that some visited entities will not satisfy the search requirements , so that the route may need to go via several entities of the same type . in an interactive search , the user provides feedback regarding her satisfaction with entities she visits during the travel , and the system changes the route , in real time , accordingly . the goal is to use the interaction for computing a route that is more effective than a route that is computed in a non-interactive fashion .

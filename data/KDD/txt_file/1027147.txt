towards nic-based intrusion detection we present and evaluate a nic-based network intrusion detection system . intrusion detection at the nic makes the system potentially tamper-proof and is naturally extensible to work in a distributed setting . simple anomaly detection and signature detection based models have been implemented on the nic firmware , which has its own processor and memory . we empirically evaluate such systems from the perspective of quality and performance ( bandwidth of acceptable messages ) under varying conditions of host load . the preliminary results we obtain are very encouraging and lead us to believe that such nic-based security schemes could very well be a crucial part of next generation network security systems .

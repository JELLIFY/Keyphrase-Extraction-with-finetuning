domain-constrained semi-supervised mining of tracking models in sensor networks accurate localization of mobile objects is a major research problem in sensor networks and an important data mining application . specifically , the localization problem is to determine the location of a client device accurately given the radio signal strength values received at the client device from multiple beacon sensors or access points . conventional data mining and machine learning methods can be applied to solve this problem . however , all of them require large amounts of labeled training data , which can be quite expensive . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic semi supervised learning approach to reduce the calibration effort and increase the tracking accuracy . our method is based on semi-supervised conditional random fields which can enhance the learned model from a small set of training data with abundant unlabeled data effectively . to make our method more efficient , we exploit a generalized em algorithm coupled with domain constraints . we validate our method through extensive experiments in a real sensor network using crossbow mica2 sensors . the results demonstrate the advantages of methods compared to other state-of-the-art object-tracking algorithms .

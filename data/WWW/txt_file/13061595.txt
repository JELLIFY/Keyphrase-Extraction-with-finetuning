domain-independent entity extraction from web search query logs query logs of a web search engine have been increasingly used as a vital source for data mining . this paper presents a study on large-scale domain-independent entity extraction from search query logs . we present a completely unsupervised method to extract entities by applying pattern-based heuristics and statistical measures . we compare against existing techniques that use web documents as well as search logs , and show that we improve over the state of the art . we also provide an in-depth qualitative analysis outlining differences and commonalities between these methods .

better abstractions for secure server-side scripting it is notoriously difficult to program a solid web application . besides addressing web interactions , state maintenance , and whimsical user navigation behaviors , programmers must also avoid a minefield of security vulnerabilities . the problem is twofold . first , we lack a clear understanding of the new computation model underlying web applications . second , we lack proper abstractions for hiding common and subtle coding details that are orthogonal to the business functionalities of specific web applications . this paper addresses both issues . first , we present a language bass for declarative server-side scripting . bass allows programmers to work in an ideal world , using new abstractions to tackle common but problematic aspects of web programming . the meta properties of bass provide useful security guarantees . second , we present a language moss reflecting realistic web programming concepts and scenarios , thus articulating the computation model behind web programming . finally , we present a translation from bass to moss , demonstrating how the ideal programming model and security guarantees of bass can be implemented in practice .

visibly pushdown automata for streaming xml we propose the study of visibly pushdown automata ( vpa ) for processing xml documents . vpas are pushdown automata where the input determines the stack operation , and xml documents are naturally visibly pushdown with the vpa pushing onto the stack on open-tags and popping the stack on close-tags . in this paper we demonstrate the power and ease visibly pushdown automata give in the design of streaming algorithms for xml documents . we study the problems of type-checking streaming xml documents against sdtd schemas , and the problem of typing tags in a streaming xml document according to an sdtd schema . for the latter problem , we consider both pre-order typing and post-order typing of a document , which dynamically determines types at open-tags and close-tags respectively as soon as they are met . we also generalize the problems of pre-order and post-order typing to prefix querying . we show that a deterministic vpa yields an algorithm to the problem of answering in one pass the set of all answers to any query that has the property that a node satisfying the query is determined solely by the prefix leading to the node . all the streaming algorithms we develop in this paper are based on the construction of deterministic vpas , and hence , for any fixed problem , the algorithms process each element of the input in constant time , and use space ( d ) , where d is the depth of the document .

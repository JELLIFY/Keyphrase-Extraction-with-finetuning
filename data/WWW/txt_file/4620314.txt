image classification for mobile web browsing it is difficult for users of mobile devices such as cellular phones equipped with a small screen and a poor input interface to browse web pages designed for desktop pcs with large displays . many studies and commercial products have tried to solve this problem . web pages include images that have various roles such as site menus , line headers for itemization , and page titles . however , most studies of mobile web browsing have n't paid much attention to the roles of web images . in this paper , we define eleven web image categories according to their roles and use these categories for proper web image handling . we manually categorized 3,901 web images collected from forty web sites and extracted image features of each category according to the classification . by making use of the extracted features , we devised an automatic web image classification method . furthermore , we evaluated the automatic classification of real web pages and achieved up to 83.1 % classification accuracy . we also implemented an automatic web page scrolling system as an application of our automatic image classification method .

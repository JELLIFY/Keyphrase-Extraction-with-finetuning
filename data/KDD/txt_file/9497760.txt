mining preferences from superior and inferior examples mining user preferences plays a critical role in many important applications such as customer relationship management ( crm ) , product and service recommendation , and marketing campaigns . in this paper , we identify an interesting and practical problem of mining user preferences : in a multidimensional space where the user preferences on some categorical attributes are unknown , from some superior and inferior examples provided by a user , can we learn about the user 's preferences on those categorical attributes ? we model the problem systematically and show that mining user preferences from superior and inferior examples is challenging . although the problem has great potential in practice , to the best of our knowledge , it has not been explored systematically before . as the first attempt to tackle the problem , we propose a greedy method and show that our method is practical using real data sets and synthetic data sets .

exploiting the web for point-in-time file sharing we describe a simple approach to `` point-in-time '' file sharing based on time expiring web links and personal webservers . this approach to file sharing is useful in environments where instant messaging clients are varied and do n't necessarily support ( compatible ) file transfer protocols . we discuss the features of such an approach along with a successfully deployed implementation now in wide use throughout the ibm corporation .

snare : a link analytic system for graph labeling and risk detection classifying nodes in networks is a task with a wide range of applications . it can be particularly useful in anomaly and fraud detection . many resources are invested in the task of fraud detection due to the high cost of fraud , and being able to automatically detect potential fraud quickly and precisely allows human investigators to work more efficiently . many data analytic schemes have been put into use ; however , schemes that bolster link analysis prove promising . this work builds upon the belief propagation algorithm for use in detecting collusion and other fraud schemes . we propose an algorithm called snare ( social network analysis for risk evaluation ) . by allowing one to use domain knowledge as well as link knowledge , the method was very successful for pinpointing misstated accounts in our sample of general ledger data , with a significant improvement over the default heuristic in true positive rates , and a lift factor of up to 6.5 ( more than twice that of the default heuristic ) . we also apply snare to the task of graph labeling in general on publicly-available datasets . we show that with only some information about the nodes themselves in a network , we get surprisingly high accuracy of labels . not only is snare applicable in a wide variety of domains , but it is also robust to the choice of parameters and highly scalable-linearly with the number of edges in a graph .

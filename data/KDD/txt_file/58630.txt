hierarchical model-based clustering of large datasets through fractionation and refractionation the goal of clustering is to identify distinct groups in a dataset . compared to non-parametric clustering methods like complete linkage , hierarchical model-based clustering has the advantage of offering a way to estimate the number of groups present in the data . however , its computational cost is quadratic in the number of items to be clustered , and it is therefore not applicable to large problems . we review an idea called fractionation , originally conceived by cutting , karger , pedersen and tukey for non-parametric hierarchical clustering of large datasets , and describe an adaptation of fractionation to model-based clustering . a further extension , called refractionation , leads to a procedure that can be successful even in the difficult situation where there are large numbers of small groups .

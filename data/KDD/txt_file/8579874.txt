the `` dgx '' distribution for mining massive , skewed data skewed distributions appear very often in practice . unfortunately , the traditional zipf distribution often fails to model them well . in this paper , we propose a new probability distribution , the discrete gaussian exponential ( dgx ) , to achieve excellent fits in a wide variety of settings ; our new distribution includes the zipf distribution as a special case . we present a statistically sound method for estimating the dgx parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) . we applied dgx to a wide variety of real world data sets , such as sales data from a large retailer chain , us-age data from at&t , and internet clickstream data ; in all cases , dgx fits these distributions very well , with almost a 99 % correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots . our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data . finally , we illustrate the power of dgx as a new tool for data mining tasks , such as outlier detection .

the eigentrust algorithm for reputation management in p2p networks peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much attention as a means of sharing and distributing information . however , as recent experience shows , the anonymous , open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files . we describe an algorithm to decrease the number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that assigns each peer a unique global trust value , based on the peer 's history of uploads . we present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values , based on power iteration . by having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download , the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network . in simulations , this reputation system , called eigentrust , has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network , even under a variety of conditions where malicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system .

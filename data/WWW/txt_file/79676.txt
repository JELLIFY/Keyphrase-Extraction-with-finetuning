a web services architecture for learning object discovery and assembly courseware systems are often based on an assembly of different components , addressing the different needs of storage and delivery functionality . the learning technology standard architecture ltsa provides a generic architectural framework for these systems . recent developments in web technology -- e.g. the web services framework -- have greatly enhanced the flexible and interoperable implementation of courseware architectures . we argue that in order to make the web services philosophy work , two enhancements to the ltsa approach are required . firstly , a combination with metadata annotation is needed to support the discovery of educational web services . secondly , if these components are to be provided in form of services , more support is needed for their assembly . architectural patterns of a finer degree of granularity shall satisfy this need .

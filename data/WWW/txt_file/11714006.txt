viskqwl , a visual renderer for a semantic web query language kiwi is a semantic wiki that combines the wiki philosophy of collaborative content creation with the methods of the semantic web in order to enable effective knowledge management . querying a wiki must be simple enough for beginning users , yet powerful enough to accommodate experienced users . to this end , the keyword-based kiwi query language ( kwql ) supports queries ranging from simple lists of keywords to expressive rules for selecting and reshaping wiki ( meta - ) data . in this demo , we showcase viskwql , a visual interface for the kwql language aimed at supporting users in the query construction process . viskwql and its editor are described , and their functionality is illustrated using example queries . viskwql 's editor provides guidance throughout the query construction process through hints , warnings and highlighting of syntactic errors . the editor enables round-tripping between the twin languages kwql and viskwql , meaning that users can switch freely between the textual and visual form when constructing or editing a query . it is implemented using html , javascript , and css , and can thus be used in ( almost ) any web browser without any additional software .

preference-based selection of highly configurable web services a key challenge for dynamic web service selection is that web services are typically highly configurable and service requesters often have dynamic preferences on service configurations . current approaches , such as ws-agreement , describe web services by enumerating the various possible service configurations , an inefficient approach when dealing with numerous service attributes with large value spaces . we model web service configurations and associated prices and preferences more compactly using utility function policies , which also allows us to draw from multi-attribute decision theory methods to develop an algorithm for optimal service selection . in this paper , we present an owl ontology for the specification of configurable web service offers and requests , and a flexible and extensible framework for optimal service selection that combines declarative logic-based matching rules with optimization methods , such as linear programming . assuming additive price\/preference functions , experimental results indicate that our algorithm introduces an overhead of only around 2 sec . ~ compared to random service selection , while giving optimal results . the overhead , as percentage of total time , decreases as the number of offers and configurations increase .

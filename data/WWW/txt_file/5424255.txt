wake-on-wlan in bridging the digital divide , two important criteria are cost-effectiveness , and power optimization . while 802.11 is cost-effective and is being used in several installations in the developing world , typical system configurations are not really power efficient . in this paper , we propose a novel `` wake-on-wlan '' mechanism for coarse-grained , on-demand power on\/off of the networking equipment at a remote site . the novelty also lies in our implementation of a prototype system using low-power 802.15.4-based sensor motes . we describe the prototype , as well as its evaluation on field in a wifi testbed . preliminary estimates indicate that the proposed mechanism can save significant power in typical rural networking settings .

privacy in dynamic social networks anonymization of social networks before they are published or shared has become an important research question . recent work on anonymizing social networks has looked at privacy preserving techniques for publishing a single instance of the network . however , social networks evolve and a single instance is inadequate for analyzing the evolution of the social network or for performing any longitudinal data analysis . we study the problem of repeatedly publishing social network data as the network evolves , while preserving privacy of users . publishing multiple instances of the same network independently has privacy risks , since stitching the information together may allow an adversary to identify users in the networks . we propose methods to anonymize a dynamic network such that the privacy of users is preserved when new nodes and edges are added to the published network . these methods make use of link prediction algorithms to model the evolution of the social network . using this predicted graph to perform group-based anonymization , the loss in privacy caused by new edges can be reduced . we evaluate the privacy loss on publishing multiple social network instances using our methods .

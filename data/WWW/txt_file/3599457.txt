improving text collection selection with coverage and overlap statistics in an environment of distributed text collections , the first step in the information retrieval process is to identify which of all available collections are more relevant to a given query and which should thus be accessed to answer the query . we address the challenge of collection selection when there is full or partial overlap between the available text collections , a scenario which has not been examined previously despite its real-world applications . to that end , we present cosco , a collection selection approach which uses collection-specific coverage and overlap statistics . we describe our experimental results which show that the presented approach displays the desired behavior of retrieving more new results early on in the collection order , and performs consistently and significantly better than cori , previously considered to be one of the best collection selection systems .

automatic generation of web portals using artificial ants we present in this work a new model ( named anttree ) based on artificial ants for document hierarchical clustering . this model is inspired from the self-assembly behavior of real ants . we have simulated this behavior to build a hierarchical tree-structured partitioning of a set of documents , according to the similarities between these documents . we have successfully compared our results to those obtained by ascending hierarchical clustering .

web-scale entity-relation search architecture enabling entity search and ranking at web-scale is fraught with many challenges : annotating the corpus with entities and types , query language design , index design , query processing logic , and answer consolidation . we describe a web-scale entity search engine we are building to handle over a billion web pages , over 200,000 types , over 1,500,000 entities , and hundreds of entity annotations per page . we describe the design of compressed , token span oriented indices for entity and type annotations . our prototype demonstrates the practicality of web-scale entity-relation search .

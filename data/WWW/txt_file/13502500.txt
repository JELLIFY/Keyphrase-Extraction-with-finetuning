web 2.0 : blind to an accessible new world with the advent of web 2.0 technologies , websites have evolved from static pages to dynamic , interactive web-based applications with the ability to replicate common desktop functionality . however , for blind and visually impaired individuals who rely upon screen readers , web 2.0 applications force them to adapt to an inaccessible use model . many technologies , including wai-aria , ajax , and improved screen reader support , are rapidly evolving to improve this situation . however , simply combining them does not solve the problems of screen reader users . the main contributions of this paper are two models of interaction for screen reader users , for both traditional websites and web 2.0 applications . further contributions are a discussion of accessibility difficulties screen reader users encounter when interacting with web 2.0 applications , a user workflow design model for improving web 2.0 accessibility , and a set of design requirements for developers to ease the user 's burden and increase accessibility . these models , accessibility difficulties , and design implications are based directly on responses and lessons learned from usability research focusing on web 2.0 usage and screen reader users . without the conscious effort of web engineers and designers , most blind and visually impaired users will shy away from using new web 2.0 technology in favor of desktop based applications .

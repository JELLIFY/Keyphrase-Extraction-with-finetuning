algorithms for time series knowledge mining temporal patterns composed of symbolic intervals are commonly formulated with allen 's interval relations originating in temporal reasoning . this representation has severe disadvantages for knowledge discovery . the time series knowledge representation ( tskr ) is a new hierarchical language for interval patterns expressing the temporal concepts of coincidence and partial order . we present effective and efficient mining algorithms for such patterns based on itemset techniques . a novel form of search space pruning effectively reduces the size of the mining result to ease interpretation and speed up the algorithms . on a real data set a concise set of tskr patterns can explain the underlying temporal phenomena , whereas the patterns found with allen 's relations are far more numerous yet only explain fragments of the data .

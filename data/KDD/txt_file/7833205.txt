detecting privacy leaks using corpus-based association rules detecting inferences in documents is critical for ensuring privacy when sharing information . in this paper , we propose a refined and practical model of inference detection using a reference corpus . our model is inspired by association rule mining : inferences are based on word co-occurrences . using the model and taking the web as the reference corpus , we can find inferences and measure their strength through web-mining algorithms that leverage search engines such as google or yahoo ! . our model also includes the important case of private corpora , to model inference detection in enterprise settings in which there is a large private document repository . we find inferences in private corpora by using analogs of our web-mining algorithms , relying on an index for the corpus rather than a web search engine . we present results from two experiments . the first experiment demonstrates the performance of our techniques in identifying all the keywords that allow for inference of a particular topic ( e.g. `` hiv '' ) with confidence above a certain threshold . the second experiment uses the public enron e-mail dataset . we postulate a sensitive topic and use the enron corpus and the web together to find inferences for the topic . these experiments demonstrate that our techniques are practical , and that our model of inference based on word co-occurrence is well-suited to efficient inference detection .

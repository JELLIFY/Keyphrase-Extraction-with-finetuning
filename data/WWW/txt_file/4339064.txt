brand awareness and the evaluation of search results we investigate the effect of search engine brand ( i.e. , the identifying name or logo that distinguishes a product from its competitors ) on evaluation of system performance . this research is motivated by the large amount of search traffic directed to a handful of web search engines , even though most are of equal technical quality with similar interfaces . we conducted a laboratory study with 32 participants to measure the effect of four search engine brands while controlling for the quality of search engine results . there was a 25 % difference between the most highly rated search engine and the lowest using average relevance ratings , even though search engine results were identical in both content and presentation . qualitative analysis suggests branding affects user views of popularity , trust and specialization . we discuss implications for search engine marketing and the design of search engine quality studies .

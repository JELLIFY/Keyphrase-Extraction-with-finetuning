tag-based social interest discovery the success and popularity of social network systems , such as del. icio . us , facebook , myspace , and youtube , have generated many interesting and challenging problems to the research community . among others , discovering social interests shared by groups of users is very important because it helps to connect people with common interests and encourages people to contribute and share more contents . the main challenge to solving this problem comes from the difficulty of detecting and representing the interest of the users . the existing approaches are all based on the online connections of users and so unable to identify the common interest of users who have no online connections . in this paper , we propose a novel social interest discovery approach based on user-generated tags . our approach is motivated by the key observation that in a social network , human users tend to use descriptive tags to annotate the contents that they are interested in . our analysis on a large amount of real-world traces reveals that in general , user-generated tags are consistent with the web content they are attached to , while more concise and closer to the understanding and judgments of human users about the content . thus , patterns of frequent co-occurrences of user tags can be used to characterize and capture topics of user interests . we have developed an internet social interest discovery system , isid , to discover the common user interests and cluster users and their saved urls by different interest topics . our evaluation shows that isid can effectively cluster similar documents by interest topics and discover user communities with common interests no matter if they have any online connections .

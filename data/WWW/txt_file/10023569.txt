autonomous resource provisioning for multi-service web applications dynamic resource provisioning aims at maintaining the end-to-end response time of a web application within a pre-defined sla . although the topic has been well studied for monolithic applications , provisioning resources for applications composed of multiple services remains a challenge . when the sla is violated , one must decide which service ( s ) should be reprovisioned for optimal effect . we propose to assign an sla only to the front-end service . other services are not given any particular response time objectives . services are autonomously responsible for their own provisioning operations and collaboratively negotiate performance objectives with each other to decide the provisioning service ( s ) . we demonstrate through extensive experiments that our system can add\/remove\/shift both servers and caches within an entire multi-service application under varying workloads to meet the sla target and improve resource utilization .

constrained optimization for validation-guided conditional random field learning conditional random fields ( crfs ) are a class of undirected graphical models which have been widely used for classifying and labeling sequence data . the training of crfs is typically formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem that maximizes the conditional likelihood . however , maximum likelihood training is prone to overfitting . to address this issue , we propose a novel constrained nonlinear optimization formulation in which the prediction accuracy of cross-validation sets are included as constraints . instead of requiring multiple passes of training , the constrained formulation allows the cross-validation be handled in one pass of constrained optimization . the new formulation is discontinuous , and classical lagrangian based constraint handling methods are not applicable . a new constrained optimization algorithm based on the recently proposed extended saddle point theory is developed to learn the constrained crf model . experimental results on gene and stock-price prediction tasks show that the constrained formulation is able to significantly improve the generalization ability of crf training .

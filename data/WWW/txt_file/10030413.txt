collaborative filtering for orkut communities : discovery of user latent behavior users of social networking services can connect with each other by forming communities for online interaction . yet as the number of communities hosted by such websites grows over time , users have even greater need for effective community recommendations in order to meet more users . in this paper , we investigate two algorithms from very different domains and evaluate their effectiveness for personalized community recommendation . first is association rule mining ( arm ) , which discovers associations between sets of communities that are shared across many users . second is latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) , which models user-community co-occurrences using latent aspects . in comparing lda with arm , we are interested in discovering whether modeling low-rank latent structure is more effective for recommendations than directly mining rules from the observed data . we experiment on an orkut data set consisting of 492,104 users and 118,002 communities . our empirical comparisons using the top-k recommendations metric show that lda performs consistently better than arm for the community recommendation task when recommending a list of 4 or more communities . however , for recommendation lists of up to 3 communities , arm is still a bit better . we analyze examples of the latent information learned by lda to explain this finding . to efficiently handle the large-scale data set , we parallelize lda on distributed computers and demonstrate our parallel implementation 's scalability with varying numbers of machines .

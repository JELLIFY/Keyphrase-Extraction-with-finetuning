towards autonomic web-sites based on learning automata autonomics or self-reorganization becomes pertinent for web-sites serving a large number of users with highly varying workloads . an important component of self-adaptation is to model the behavior of users and adapt accordingly . this paper proposes a learning-automata based technique for model discovery . user access patterns are used to construct an fsm model of user behavior that in turn is used for prediction and prefetching . the proposed technique uses a generalization algorithm to classify behavior patterns into a small number of generalized classes . it has been tested on both synthetic and live data-sets and has shown a prediction hit-rate of up to 89 % on a real web-site .

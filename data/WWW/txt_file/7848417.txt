non-intrusive monitoring and service adaptation for ws-bpel web service processes currently lack monitoring and dynamic ( runtime ) adaptation mechanisms . in highly dynamic processes , services frequently need to be exchanged due to a variety of reasons . in this paper we present viedame , a system which allows monitoring of bpel processes according to quality of service ( qos ) attributes and replacement of existing partner services based on various ( pluggable ) replacement strategies . the chosen replacement services can be syntactically or semantically equivalent to the bpel interface . services can be automatically replaced during runtime without any downtime of the overall system . we implemented our solution with an aspect-oriented approach by intercepting soap messages and allow services to be exchanged during runtime with little performance penalty costs , as shown in our experiments , thereby making our approach suitable for high-availability bpel environments .

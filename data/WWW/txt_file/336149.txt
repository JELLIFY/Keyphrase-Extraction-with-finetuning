position paper : ontology construction from online ontologies one of the main hurdles towards a wide endorsement of ontologies is the high cost of constructing them . reuse of existing ontologies offers a much cheaper alternative than building new ones from scratch , yet tools to support such reuse are still in their infancy . however , more ontologies are becoming available on the web , and online libraries for storing and indexing ontologies are increasing in number and demand . search engines have also started to appear , to facilitate search and retrieval of online ontologies . this paper presents a fresh view on constructing ontologies automatically , by identifying , ranking , and merging fragments of online ontologies .

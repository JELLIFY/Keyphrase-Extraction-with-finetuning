tracking multiple topics for finding interesting articles we introduce multiple topic tracking ( mtt ) for iscore to better recommend news articles for users with multiple interests and to address changes in user interests over time . as an extension of the basic rocchio algorithm , traditional topic detection and tracking , and single-pass clustering , mtt maintains multiple interest profiles to identify interesting articles for a specific user given user-feedback . focusing on only interesting topics enables iscore to discard useless profiles to address changes in user interests and to achieve a balance between resource consumption and classification accuracy . also by relating a topic 's interestingness to an article . s interestingness , iscore is able to achieve higher quality results than traditional methods such as the rocchio algorithm . we identify several operating parameters that work well for mtt . using the same parameters , we show that mtt alone yields high quality results for recommending interesting articles from several corpora . the inclusion of mtt improves iscore 's performance by 9 % in recommending news articles from the yahoo ! news rss feeds and the trec11 adaptive filter article collection . and through a small user study , we show that iscore can still perform well when only provided with little user feedback .

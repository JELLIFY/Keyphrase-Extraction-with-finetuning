arnetminer : extraction and mining of academic social networks this paper addresses several key issues in the arnetminer system , which aims at extracting and mining academic social networks . specifically , the system focuses on : 1 ) extracting researcher profiles automatically from the web ; 2 ) integrating the publication data into the network from existing digital libraries ; 3 ) modeling the entire academic network ; and 4 ) providing search services for the academic network . so far , 448,470 researcher profiles have been extracted using a unified tagging approach . we integrate publications from online web databases and propose a probabilistic framework to deal with the name ambiguity problem . furthermore , we propose a unified modeling approach to simultaneously model topical aspects of papers , authors , and publication venues . search services such as expertise search and people association search have been provided based on the modeling results . in this paper , we describe the architecture and main features of the system . we also present the empirical evaluation of the proposed methods .

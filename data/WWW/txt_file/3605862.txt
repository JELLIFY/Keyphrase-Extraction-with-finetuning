extracting context to improve accuracy for html content extraction previous work on content extraction utilized various heuristics such as link to text ratio , prominence of tables , and identification of advertising . many of these heuristics were associated with `` settings '' , whereby some heuristics could be turned on or off and others parameterized by minimum or maximum threshold values . a given collection of settings - such as removing table cells with high linked to non-linked text ratios and removing all apparent advertising -- might work very well for a news website , but leave little or no content left for the reader of a shopping site or a web portal we present a new technique , based on incrementally clustering websites using search engine snippets , to associate a newly requested website with a particular `` genre '' , and then employ settings previously determined to be appropriate for that genre , with dramatically improved content extraction results overall .

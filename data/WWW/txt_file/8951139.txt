soundness proof of z semantics of owl using institutions the correctness of the z semantics of owl is the theoretical foundation of using software engineering techniques to verify web ontologies . as owl and z are based on different logical systems , we use institutions to represent their underlying logical systems and use institution morphisms to prove the correctness of the z semantics for owl dl .

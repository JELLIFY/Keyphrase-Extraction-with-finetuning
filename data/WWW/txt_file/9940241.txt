personalized recommendation on dynamic content using predictive bilinear models in web-based services of dynamic content ( such as news articles ) , recommender systems face the difficulty of timely identifying new items of high-quality and providing recommendations for new users . we propose a feature-based machine learning approach to personalized recommendation that is capable of handling the cold-start issue effectively . we maintain profiles of content of interest , in which temporal characteristics of the content , e.g. popularity and freshness , are updated in real-time manner . we also maintain profiles of users including demographic information and a summary of user activities within yahoo ! properties . based on all features in user and content profiles , we develop predictive bilinear regression models to provide accurate personalized recommendations of new items for both existing and new users . this approach results in an offline model with light computational overhead compared with other recommender systems that require online re-training . the proposed framework is general and flexible for other personalized tasks . the superior performance of our approach is verified on a large-scale data set collected from the today-module on yahoo ! front page , with comparison against six competitive approaches .

using landing pages for sponsored search ad selection we explore the use of the landing page content in sponsored search ad selection . specifically , we compare the use of the ad 's intrinsic content to augmenting the ad with the whole , or parts , of the landing page . we explore two types of extractive summarization techniques to select useful regions from the landing pages : out-of-context and in-context methods . out-of-context methods select salient regions from the landing page by analyzing the content alone , without taking into account the ad associated with the landing page . in-context methods use the ad context ( including its title , creative , and bid phrases ) to help identify regions of the landing page that should be used by the ad selection engine . in addition , we introduce a simple yet effective unsupervised algorithm to enrich the ad context to further improve the ad selection . experimental evaluation confirms that the use of landing pages can significantly improve the quality of ad selection . we also find that our extractive summarization techniques reduce the size of landing pages substantially , while retaining or even improving the performance of ad retrieval over the method that utilize the entire landing page .

semantic web applications to e-science in silico experiments this paper explains our research and implementations of manual , automatic and deep annotations of provenance logs for e-science insilico experiments . compared to annotating general web documents , annotations for scientific data require more sophisticated professional knowledge to recognize concepts from documents , and more complex text extraction and mapping mechanisms . a simple automatic annotation approach based on `` lexicons '' and a deep annotation implemented by semantically populating , translating and annotating provenance logs are introduced in this paper . we used cohse ( conceptual open hypermedia services environment ) to annotate and browse provenance logs from my grid project , which are conceptually linked together as a hypertext web of provenance logs and experiment resources , based on the associated conceptual metadata and reasoning over these metadata .

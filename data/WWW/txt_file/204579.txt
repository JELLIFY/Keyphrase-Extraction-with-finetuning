aliasing on the world wide web : prevalence and performance implications aliasing occurs in web transactions when requests containing different urls elicit replies containing identical data payloads . conventional caches associate stored data with urls and can therefore suffer redundant payload transfers due to aliasing and other causes . existing research literature , however , says little about the prevalence of aliasing in user-initiated transactions , or about redundant payload transfers in conventional web cache hierarchies . this paper quantifies the extent of aliasing and the performance impact of url-indexed cache management using a large client trace from webtv networks . fewer than 5 % of reply payloads are aliased ( referenced via multiple urls ) but over 54 % of successful transactions involve aliased payloads . aliased payloads account for under 3.1 % of the trace 's `` working set size '' ( sum of payload sizes ) but over 36 % of bytes transferred . for the webtv workload , roughly 10 % of payload transfers to browser caches and 23 % of payload transfers to a shared proxy are redundant , assuming infinite-capacity conventional caches . our analysis of a large proxy trace from compaq corporation yields similar results.url-indexed caching does not entirely explain the large number of redundant proxy-to-browser payload transfers previously reported in the webtv system . we consider other possible causes of redundant transfers ( e.g. , reply metadata and browser cache management policies ) and discuss a simple hop-by-hop protocol extension that completely eliminates all redundant transfers , regardless of cause .

a method for transparent admission control and request scheduling in e-commerce web sites this paper presents a method for admission control and request scheduling for multiply-tiered e-commerce web sites , achieving both stable behavior during overload and improved response times . our method externally observes execution costs of requests online , distinguishing different request types , and performs overload protection and preferential scheduling using relatively simple measurements and a straight forward control mechanism . unlike previous proposals , which require extensive changes to the server or operating system , our method requires no modifications to the host o.s. , web server , application server or database . since our method is external , it can be implemented in a proxy . we present such an implementation , called gatekeeper , using it with standard software components on the linux operating system . we evaluate the proxy using the industry standard tpc-w workload generator in a typical three-tiered e-commerce environment . we show consistent performance during overload and throughput increases of up to 10 percent . response time improves by up to a factor of 14 , with only a 15 percent penalty to large jobs .

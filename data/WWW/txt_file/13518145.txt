bid optimization for broad match ad auctions ad auctions in sponsored search support `` broad match '' that allows an advertiser to target a large number of queries while bidding only on a limited number . while giving more expressiveness to advertisers , this feature makes it challenging to optimize bids to maximize their returns : choosing to bid on a query as a broad match because it provides high profit results in one bidding for related queries which may yield low or even negative profits . we abstract and study the complexity of the { \ em bid optimization problem } which is to determine an advertiser 's bids on a subset of keywords ( possibly using broad match ) so that her profit is maximized . in the query language model when the advertiser is allowed to bid on all queries as broad match , we present a linear programming ( lp ) - based polynomial-time algorithm that gets the optimal profit . in the model in which an advertiser can only bid on keywords , ie. , a subset of keywords as an exact or broad match , we show that this problem is not approximable within any reasonable approximation factor unless p = np . to deal with this hardness result , we present a constant-factor approximation when the optimal profit significantly exceeds the cost . this algorithm is based on rounding a natural lp formulation of the problem . finally , we study a budgeted variant of the problem , and show that in the query language model , one can find two budget constrained ad campaigns in polynomial time that implement the optimal bidding strategy . our results are the first to address bid optimization under the broad match feature which is common in ad auctions .

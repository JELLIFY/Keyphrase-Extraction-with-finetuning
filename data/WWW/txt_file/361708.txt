preferential walk : towards efficient and scalable search in unstructured peer-to-peer networks to improve search efficiency and reduce unnecessary traffic in peer-to-peer ( p2p ) networks , this paper proposes a trust-based probabilistic search algorithm , called preferential walk ( p-walk ) . every peer ranks its neighbors according to searching experience . the highly ranked neighbors have higher probabilities to be queried . simulation results show that p-walk is not only efficient , but also robust against malicious behaviors . furthermore , we measure peers ' rank distribution and draw implications .

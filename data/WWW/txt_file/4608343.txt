hybrid semantic tagging for information extraction the semantic web is expected to have an impact at least as big as that of the existing html based web , if not greater . however , the challenge lays in creating this semantic web and in converting existing web information into the semantic paradigm . one of the core technologies that can help in migration process is automatic markup , the semantic markup of content , providing the semantic tags to describe the raw content . this paper describes a hybrid statistical and knowledge-based information extraction model , able to extract entities and relations at the sentence level . the model attempts to retain and improve the high accuracy levels of knowledge-based systems while drastically reducing the amount of manual labor by relying on statistics drawn from a training corpus . the implementation of the model , called teg ( trainable extraction grammar ) , can be adapted to any ie domain by writing a suitable set of rules in a scfg ( stochastic context free grammar ) based extraction language , and training them using an annotated corpus . the experiments show that our hybrid approach outperforms both purely statistical and purely knowledge-based systems , while requiring orders of magnitude less manual rule writing and smaller amount of training data . we also demonstrate the robustness of our system under conditions of poor training data quality . this makes the system very suitable for converting legacy web pages to semantic web pages .

foundations for service ontologies : aligning owl-s to dolce clarity in semantics and a rich formalization of this semantics are important requirements for ontologies designed to be deployed in large-scale , open , distributed systems such as the envisioned semantic web this is especially important for the description of web services , which should enable complex tasks involving multiple agents . as one of the first initiatives of the semantic webcommunity for describing web services , owl-s attracts a lot of interest even though it is still under development . we identify problematic aspects of owl-s and suggest enhancements through alignment to a foundational ontology . another contribution of ourwork is the core ontology of services that tries to fill the epistemological gap between the foundational ontology and owl-s . it can be reused to align other web service description languages as well . finally , we demonstrate the applicability of our work byaligning owl-s ' standard example called congobuy .

towards liquid service oriented architectures the advent of cloud computing platforms , and the growing pervasiveness of multicore processor architectures have revealed the inadequateness of traditional programming models based on sequential computations , opening up many challenges for research on parallel programming models for building distributed , service-oriented systems . more in detail , the dynamic nature of cloud computing and its virtualized infrastructure pose new challenges in term of application design , deployment and dynamic reconfiguration . an application developed to be delivered as a service in the cloud has to deal with poorly understood issues such as elasticity , infinite scalability and portability across heterogeneous virtualized environments . in this position paper we define the problem of providing a novel parallel programming model for building application services that can be transparently deployed on multicore and cloud execution environments . to this end , we introduce and motivate a research plan for the definition of a novel programming framework for web service-based applications . our vision called `` liquid architecture '' is based on a programming model inspired by core ideas tied to the rest architectural style coupled with a self-configuring runtime that allows transparent deployment of web services on a broad range of heterogeneous platforms , from multicores to clouds .

probabilistic models for discovering e-communities the increasing amount of communication between individuals in e-formats ( e.g. email , instant messaging and the web ) has motivated computational research in social network analysis ( sna ) . previous work in sna has emphasized the social network ( sn ) topology measured by communication frequencies while ignoring the semantic information in sns . in this paper , we propose two generative bayesian models for semantic community discovery in sns , combining probabilistic modeling with community detection in sns . to simulate the generative models , an enf-gibbs sampling algorithm is proposed to address the efficiency and performance problems of traditional methods . experimental studies on enron email corpus show that our approach successfully detects the communities of individuals and in addition provides semantic topic descriptions of these communities .

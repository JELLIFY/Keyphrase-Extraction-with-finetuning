gbase : a scalable and general graph management system graphs appear in numerous applications including cyber-security , the internet , social networks , protein networks , recommendation systems , and many more . graphs with millions or even billions of nodes and edges are common-place . how to store such large graphs efficiently ? what are the core operations\/queries on those graph ? how to answer the graph queries quickly ? we propose gbase , a scalable and general graph management and mining system . the key novelties lie in 1 ) our storage and compression scheme for a parallel setting and 2 ) the carefully chosen graph operations and their efficient implementation . we designed and implemented an instance of gbase using mapreduce\/hadoop . gbase provides a parallel indexing mechanism for graph mining operations that both saves storage space , as well as accelerates queries . we ran numerous experiments on real graphs , spanning billions of nodes and edges , and we show that our proposed gbase is indeed fast , scalable and nimble , with significant savings in space and time .

mining time-changing data streams most statistical and machine-learning algorithms assume that the data is a random sample drawn from a stationary distribution . unfortunately , most of the large databases available for mining today violate this assumption . they were gathered over months or years , and the underlying processes generating them changed during this time , sometimes radically . although a number of algorithms have been proposed for learning time-changing concepts , they generally do not scale well to very large databases . in this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for mining decision trees from continuously-changing data streams , based on the ultra-fast vfdt decision tree learner . this algorithm , called cvfdt , stays current while making the most of old data by growing an alternative subtree whenever an old one becomes questionable , and replacing the old with the new when the new becomes more accurate . cvfdt learns a model which is similar in accuracy to the one that would be learned by reapplying vfdt to a moving window of examples every time a new example arrives , but with o ( 1 ) complexity per example , as opposed to o ( w ) , where w is the size of the window . experiments on a set of large time-changing data streams demonstrate the utility of this approach .

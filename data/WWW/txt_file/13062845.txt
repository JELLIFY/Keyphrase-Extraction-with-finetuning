an adaptive ontology-based approach to identify correlation between publications in this paper , we propose an adaptive ontology-based approach for related paper identification , to meet most researchers ' practical needs . by searching ontology , we can return a diverse set of papers that are explicitly and implicitly related to an input paper . moreover , our approach does not rely on known ontology . instead , we build and update ontology for a collection with any domain of interest . being independent from known ontology , our approach is much more adaptive for different domains .

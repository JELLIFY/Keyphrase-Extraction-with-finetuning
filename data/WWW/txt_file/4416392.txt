information search and re-access strategies of experienced web users experienced web users have strategies for information search and re-access that are not directly supported by web browsers or search engines . we studied how prevalent these strategies are and whether even experienced users have problems with searching and re-accessing information . with this aim , we conducted a survey with 236 experienced web users . the results showed that this group has frequently used key strategies ( e.g. , using several browser windows in parallel ) that they find important , whereas some of the strategies that have been suggested in previous studies are clearly less important for them ( e.g. , including urls on a webpage ) . in some aspects , such as query formulation , this group resembles less experienced web users . for instance , we found that most of the respondents had misconceptions about how their search engine handles queries , as well as other problems with information search and re-access . in addition to presenting the prevalence of the strategies and rationales for their use , we present concrete designs solutions and ideas for making the key strategies also available to less experienced users .

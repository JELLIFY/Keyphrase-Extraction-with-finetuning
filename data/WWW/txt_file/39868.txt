a web middleware architecture for dynamic customization of content for wireless clients we present a new web middleware architecture that allows users to customize their view of the web for optimal interaction and system operation when using non-traditional resource-limited client machines such as wireless pdas ( personal digital assistants ) . web stream customizers ( wsc ) are dynamically deployable software modules and can be strategically located between client and server to achieve improvements in performance , reliability , or security . an important design feature is that customizers provide two points of control in the communication path between client and server , supporting adaptive system-based and content-based customization . our architecture exploits http 's proxy capabilities , allowing customizers to be seamlessly integrated with the basic web transaction model . we describe the wsc architecture and implementation , and illustrate its use with three non-trivial , adaptive customizer applications that we have built . we show that the overhead in our implementation is small and tolerable , and is outweighed by the benefits that customizers provide .

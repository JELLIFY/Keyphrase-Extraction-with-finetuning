collective privacy management in social networks social networking is one of the major technological phenomena of the web 2.0 , with hundreds of millions of people participating . social networks enable a form of self expression for users , and help them to socialize and share content with other users . in spite of the fact that content sharing represents one of the prominent features of existing social network sites , social networks yet do not support any mechanism for collaborative management of privacy settings for shared content . in this paper , we model the problem of collaborative enforcement of privacy policies on shared data by using game theory . in particular , we propose a solution that offers automated ways to share images based on an extended notion of content ownership . building upon the clarke-tax mechanism , we describe a simple mechanism that promotes truthfulness , and that rewards users who promote co-ownership . we integrate our design with inference techniques that free the users from the burden of manually selecting privacy preferences for each picture . to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such a protection mechanism for social networking has been proposed . in the paper , we also show a proof-of-concept application , which we implemented in the context of facebook , one of today 's most popular social networks . we show that supporting these type of solutions is not also feasible , but can be implemented through a minimal increase in overhead to end-users .

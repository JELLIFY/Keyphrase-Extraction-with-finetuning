translation-invariant mixture models for curve clustering in this paper we present a family of algorithms that can simultaneously align and cluster sets of multidimensional curves defined on a discrete time grid . our approach uses the expectation-maximization ( em ) algorithm to recover both the mean curve shapes for each cluster , and the most likely shifts , offsets , and cluster memberships for each curve . we demonstrate how bayesian estimation methods can improve the results for small sample sizes by enforcing smoothness in the cluster mean curves . we evaluate the methodology on two real-world data sets , time-course gene expression data and storm trajectory data . experimental results show that models that incorporate curve alignment systematically provide improvements in predictive power and within-cluster variance on test data sets . the proposed approach provides a non-parametric , computationally efficient , and robust methodology for clustering broad classes of curve data .

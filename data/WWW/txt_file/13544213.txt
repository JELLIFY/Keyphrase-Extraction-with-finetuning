discovering the staring people from social networks in this paper , we study a novel problem of staring people discovery from social networks , which is concerned with finding people who are not only authoritative but also sociable in the social network . we formalize this problem as an optimization programming problem . taking the co-author network as a case study , we define three objective functions and propose two methods to combine these objective functions . a genetic algorithm based method is further presented to solve this problem . experimental results show that the proposed solution can effectively find the staring people from social networks .

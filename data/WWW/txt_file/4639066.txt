geotracker : geospatial and temporal rss navigation the web is rapidly moving towards a platform for mass collaboration in content production and consumption . fresh content on a variety of topics , people , and places is being created and made available on the web at breathtaking speed . navigating the content effectively not only requires techniques such as aggregating various rss-enabled feeds , but it also demands a new browsing paradigm . in this paper , we present novel geospatial and temporal browsing techniques that provide users with the capability of aggregating and navigating rss-enabled content in a timely , personalized and automatic manner . in particular , we describe a system called geotracker that utilizes both a geospatial representation and a temporal ( chronological ) presentation to help users spot the most relevant updates quickly . within the context of this work , we provide a middleware engine that supports intelligent aggregation and dissemination of rss feeds with personalization to desktops and mobile devices . we study the navigation capabilities of this system on two kinds of data sets , namely , 2006 world cup soccer data collected over two months and breaking news items that occur every day . we also demonstrate that the application of such technologies to the video search results returned by youtube and google greatly enhances a user . s ability in locating and browsing videos based on his or her geographical interests . finally , we demonstrate that the location inference performance of geotracker compares well against machine learning techniques used in the natural language processing\/information retrieval community . despite its algorithm simplicity , it preserves high recall percentages .

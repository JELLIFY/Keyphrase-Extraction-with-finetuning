asdl : a wide spectrum language for designing web services a service oriented system emerges from composition of services . dynamically composed reactive web services form a special class of service oriented system , where the delays associated with communication , unreliability and unavailability of services , and competition for resources from multiple service requesters are dominant concerns . as complexity of services increase , an abstract design language for the specification of services and interaction between them is desired . in this paper , we present asdl ( abstract service design language ) , a wide spectrum language for modelling web services . we initially provide an informal description of our computational model for service oriented systems . we then present asdl along with its specification oriented semantics defined in interval temporal logic ( itl ) : a sound formalism for specifying and reasoning about temporal properties of systems . the objective of asdl is to provide a notation for the design of service composition and interaction protocols at an abstract level .

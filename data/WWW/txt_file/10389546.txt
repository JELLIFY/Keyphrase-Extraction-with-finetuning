sync kit : a persistent client-side database caching toolkit for data intensive websites we introduce a client-server toolkit called sync kit that demonstrates how client-side database storage can improve the performance of data intensive websites . sync kit is designed to make use of the embedded relational database defined in the upcoming html5 standard to offload some data storage and processing from a web server onto the web browsers to which it serves content . our toolkit provides various strategies for synchronizing relational database tables between the browser and the web server , along with a client-side template library so that portions web applications may be executed client-side . unlike prior work in this area , sync kit persists both templates and data in the browser across web sessions , increasing the number of concurrent connections a server can handle by up to a factor of four versus that of a traditional server-only web stack and a factor of three versus a recent template caching approach .

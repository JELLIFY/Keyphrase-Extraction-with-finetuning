dsnotify : handling broken links in the web of data the web of data has emerged as a way of exposing structured linked data on the web . it builds on the central building blocks of the web ( uris , http ) and benefits from its simplicity and wide-spread adoption . it does , however , also inherit the unresolved issues such as the broken link problem . broken links constitute a major challenge for actors consuming linked data as they require them to deal with reduced accessibility of data . we believe that the broken link problem is a major threat to the whole web of data idea and that both linked data consumers and providers will require solutions that deal with this problem . since no general solutions for fixing such links in the web of data have emerged , we make three contributions into this direction : first , we provide a concise definition of the broken link problem and a comprehensive analysis of existing approaches . second , we present dsnotify , a generic framework able to assist human and machine actors in fixing broken links . it uses heuristic feature comparison and employs a time-interval-based blocking technique for the underlying instance matching problem . third , we derived benchmark datasets from knowledge bases such as dbpedia and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with respect to the broken link problem . our results show the feasibility of a time-interval-based blocking approach for systems that aim at detecting and fixing broken links in the web of data .

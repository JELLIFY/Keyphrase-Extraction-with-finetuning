webpod : persistent web browsing sessions with pocketable storage devices we present webpod , a portable system that enables mobile users to use the same persistent , personalized web browsing session on any internet-enabled device . no matter what computer is being used , webpod provides a consistent browsing session , maintaining all of a user 's plugins , bookmarks , browser web content , open browser windows , and browser configuration options and preferences . this is achieved by leveraging rapid improvements in capacity , cost , and size of portable storage devices . webpod provides a virtualization and checkpoint\/restart mechanism that decouples the browsing environment from the host , enabling web browsing sessions to be suspended to portable storage , carried around , and resumed from the storage device on another computer . webpod virtualization also isolates web browsing sessions from the host , protecting the browsing privacy of the user and preventing malicious web content from damaging the host . we have implemented a linux webpod prototype and demonstrate its ability to quickly suspend and resume web browsing sessions , enabling a seamless web browsing experience for mobile users as they move among computers .

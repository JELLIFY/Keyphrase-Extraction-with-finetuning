representing personal web information using a topic-oriented interface nowadays , web activities have become daily practice for people . it is therefore essential to organize and present this continuously increasing web information in a more usable manner . in this paper , we developed a novel approach to reorganize personal web information as a topic-oriented interface . in our approach , we proposed to utilize anchor , title and url information to represent content information for the browsed web pages rather than the content body . furthermore , we explored three methods to organize personal web information : 1 ) top-down statistical clustering ; 2 ) salience phrase based clustering ; and 3 ) support vector machine ( svm ) based classification . finally , we conducted a usability study to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution . the experimental results demonstrated that users could visit the pages that have been browsed previously more easily with our approach than existing solutions .

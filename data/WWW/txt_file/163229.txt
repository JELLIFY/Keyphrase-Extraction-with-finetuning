hunter gatherer : interaction support for the creation and management of within-web-page collections hunter gatherer is an interface that lets web users carry out three main tasks : ( 1 ) collect components from within web pages ; ( 2 ) represent those components in a collection ; ( 3 ) edit those component collections . our research shows that while the practice of making collections of content from within web pages is common , it is not frequent , due in large part to poor interaction support in existing tools . we engaged with users in task analysis as well as iterative design reviews in order to understand the interaction issues that are part of within-web-page collection making and to design an interaction that would support that process . we report here on that design development , as well as on the evaluations of the tool that evolved from that process , and the future work stemming from these results , in which our critical question is : what happens to users perceptions and expectations of web-based information ( their web-based information management practices ) when they can treat this information as harvestable , recontextualizable data , rather than as fixed pages ?

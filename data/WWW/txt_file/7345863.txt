model-based version and configuration management for a web engineering lifecycle during a lifecycle of a large-scale web application , web developers produce a wide variety of inter-related web objects . following good web engineering practice , developers often create them based on a web application development method , which requires certain logical models for the development and maintenance process . web development is dynamic , thus , those logical models as well as web artifacts evolve over time . however , the task of managing their evolution is still very inefficient because design decisions in models are not directly accessible in existing file-based software configuration management repositories . key limitations of existing web version control tools include their inadequacy in representing semantics of design models and inability to manage the evolution of model-based objects and their logical connections to web documents . this paper presents a framework that allows developers to manage versions and configurations of models and to capture changes to model-to-model relations among web objects . model-based objects , web documents , and relations are directly represented and versioned in a structure-oriented manner .

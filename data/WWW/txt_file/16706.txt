implementing physical hyperlinks using ubiquitous identifier resolution identifier resolution is presented as a way to link the physical world with virtual web resources . in this paradigm , designed to support nomadic users , the user employs a handheld , wirelessly connected , sensor-equipped device to read identifiers associated with physical entities . the identifiers are resolved into virtual resources or actions related to the physical entities - as though the user ` clicked on a physical hyperlink ' . we have integrated identifier resolution with the web so that it can be deployed as ubiquitously as the web , in the infrastructure and on wirelessly connected handheld devices . we enable users to capture resolution services and applications as web resources in their local context . we use the web to invoke resolution services , with a model of ` physical ' web form-filling . we propose a scheme for binding identifiers to resources , to promote services and applications linking the physical and virtual worlds .

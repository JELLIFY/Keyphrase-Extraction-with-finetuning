lungcad : a clinically approved , machine learning system for lung cancer detection we present lungcad , a computer aided diagnosis ( cad ) system that employs a classification algorithm for detecting solid pulmonary nodules from ct thorax studies . we briefly describe some of the machine learning techniques developed to overcome the real world challenges in this medical domain . the most significant hurdle in transitioning from a machine learning research prototype that performs well on an in-house dataset into a clinically deployable system , is the requirement that the cad system be tested in a clinical trial . we describe the clinical trial in which lungcad was tested : a large scale multi-reader , multi-case ( mrmc ) retrospective observational study to evaluate the effect of cad in clinical practice for detecting solid pulmonary nodules from ct thorax studies . the clinical trial demonstrates that every radiologist that participated in the trial had a significantly greater accuracy with lungcad , both for detecting nodules and identifying potentially actionable nodules ; this , along with other findings from the trial , has resulted in fda approval for lungcad in late 2006 .

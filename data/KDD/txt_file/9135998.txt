generating succinct titles for web urls how can a search engine automatically provide the best and most appropriate title for a result url ( link-title ) so that users will be persuaded to click on the url ? we consider the problem of automatically generating link-titles for urls and propose a general statistical framework for solving this problem . the framework is based on using information from a diverse collection of sources , each of which can be thought of as contributing one or more candidate link-titles for the url . it can also incorporate the context in which the link-title will be used , along with constraints on its length . our framework is applicable to several scenarios : obtaining succinct titles for displaying quicklinks , obtaining titles for urls that lack a good title , constructing succinct sitemaps , etc. . extensive experiments show that our method is very effective , producing results that are at least 20 % better than non-trivial baselines .

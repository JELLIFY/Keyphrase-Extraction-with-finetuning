exploiting content redundancy for web information extraction we propose a novel extraction approach that exploits content redundancy on the web to extract structured data from template-based web sites . we start by populating a seed database with records extracted from a few initial sites . we then identify values within the pages of each new site that match attribute values contained in the seed set of records . to filter out noisy attribute value matches , we exploit the fact that attribute values occur at fixed positions within template-based sites . we develop an efficient apriori-style algorithm to systematically enumerate attribute position configurations with sufficient matching values across pages . finally , we conduct an extensive experimental study with real-life web data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our extraction approach .

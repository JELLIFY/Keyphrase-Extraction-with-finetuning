cold start link prediction in the traditional link prediction problem , a snapshot of a social network is used as a starting point to predict , by means of graph-theoretic measures , the links that are likely to appear in the future . in this paper , we introduce cold start link prediction as the problem of predicting the structure of a social network when the network itself is totally missing while some other information regarding the nodes is available . we propose a two-phase method based on the bootstrap probabilistic graph . the first phase generates an implicit social network under the form of a probabilistic graph . the second phase applies probabilistic graph-based measures to produce the final prediction . we assess our method empirically over a large data collection obtained from flickr , using interest groups as the initial information . the experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach .

middleware services for web service compositions ws - \* specifications cover a variety of issues ranging from security and reliability to transaction support in web services . however , these specifications do not address web service compositions . on the other hand , bpel as the future standard web service composition language allows the specification of the functional part of the composition as a business process but it fails short in expressing non-functional properties such as security , reliability and persistence . in this paper , we propose an approach for the transparent integration of technical concerns in web service compositions . our approach is driven by the analogy between web services and software components and is inspired from server-side component models such as enterprise java beans . the main components of our framework are the process container , the middleware services and the deployment descriptor .

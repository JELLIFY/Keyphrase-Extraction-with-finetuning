clope : a fast and effective clustering algorithm for transactional data this paper studies the problem of categorical data clustering , especially for transactional data characterized by high dimensionality and large volume . starting from a heuristic method of increasing the height-to-width ratio of the cluster histogram , we develop a novel algorithm -- clope , which is very fast and scalable , while being quite effective . we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on two real world datasets , and compare clope with the state-of-art algorithms .

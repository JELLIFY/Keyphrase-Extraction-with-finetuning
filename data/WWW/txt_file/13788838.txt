spotting fake reviewer groups in consumer reviews opinionated social media such as product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for their decision making . however , due to the reason of profit or fame , people try to game the system by opinion spamming ( e.g. , writing fake reviews ) to promote or demote some target products . for reviews to reflect genuine user experiences and opinions , such spam reviews should be detected . prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers . however , a fake reviewer group ( a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews ) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size . this paper studies spam detection in the collaborative setting , i.e. , to discover fake reviewer groups . the proposed method first uses a frequent itemset mining method to find a set of candidate groups . it then uses several behavioral models derived from the collusion phenomenon among fake reviewers and relation models based on the relationships among groups , individual reviewers , and products they reviewed to detect fake reviewer groups . additionally , we also built a labeled dataset of fake reviewer groups . although labeling individual fake reviews and reviewers is very hard , to our surprise labeling fake reviewer groups is much easier . we also note that the proposed technique departs from the traditional supervised learning approach for spam detection because of the inherent nature of our problem which makes the classic supervised learning approach less effective . experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms multiple strong baselines including the state-of-the-art supervised classification , regression , and learning to rank algorithms .

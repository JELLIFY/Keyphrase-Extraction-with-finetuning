the distribution of pagerank follows a power-law only for particular values of the damping factor we show that the empirical distribution of the pagerank values in a large set of web pages does not follow a power-law except for some particular choices of the damping factor . we argue that for a graph with an in-degree distribution following a power-law with exponent between 2.1 and 2.2 , choosing a damping factor around 0.85 for pagerank yields a power-law distribution of its values . we suggest that power-law distributions of pagerank in web graphs have been observed because the typical damping factor used in practice is between 0.85 and 0.90 .

xproj : a framework for projected structural clustering of xml documents xml has become a popular method of data representation both on the web and in databases in recent years . one of the reasons for the popularity of xml has been its ability to encode structural information about data records . however , this structural characteristic of data sets also makes it a challenging problem for a variety of data mining problems . one such problem is that of clustering , in which the structural aspects of the data result in a high implicit dimensionality of the data representation . as a result , it becomes more difficult to cluster the data in a meaningful way . in this paper , we propose an effective clustering algorithm for xml data which uses substructures of the documents in order to gain insights about the important underlying structures . we propose new ways of using multiple sub-structuralinformation in xml documents to evaluate the quality of intermediate cluster solutions , and guide the algorithms to a final solution which reflects the true structural behavior in individual partitions . we test the algorithm on a variety of real and synthetic data sets .
